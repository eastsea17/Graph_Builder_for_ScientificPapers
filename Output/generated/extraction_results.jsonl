For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms’ overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite.

The novel patent network contains various types of nodes that represent different features extracted from patent documents. The nodes are connected based on the relationship metrics derived from the patent metadata. The proposed classification method predicts a query patent's class by analyzing all reachable nodes in the patent network and calculating their relevance to the query patent. It then classifies the query patent with a modified k-nearest neighbor classifier. To further improve the approach, we combine it with content-based, citation-based, and metadata-based classification methods to develop a hybrid-classification approach. We evaluate the performance of the hybrid approach on a test dataset of patent documents obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and compare its performance with that of the three conventional methods.

In specific, three types of network analysis, which are centrality analysis, association rule mining analysis and brokerage network analysis, are applied to measure the individual, synergy and group intensity. Findings The core safety fields derived from three types of network analysis used by different nature of data algorithms are compared with each other to understand distinctive meaning of cores of patent class such as medical safety, working safety and vehicle safety, differentiating network structure.

We set out to investigate the angiographic patency rates of all conduits used in coronary bypass surgery by performing a network meta‐analysis of the current available randomized evidence. Methods and Results A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials comparing the angiographic patency rate of the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, the no‐touch saphenous vein, the radial artery (RA), the right internal thoracic artery, or the gastroepiploic artery. The primary outcome was graft occlusion. A total of 4160 studies were retrieved of which 14 were included with 3651 grafts analyzed. The weighted mean angiographic follow‐up was 5.1 years. Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, both the RA (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35–0.82) and the no‐touch saphenous vein (IRR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.78) were associated with lower graft occlusion. The RA ranked as the best conduit (rank score for RA 0.87 versus 0.85 for no‐touch saphenous vein, 0.23 for right internal thoracic artery, 0.29 for gastroepiploic artery, and 0.25 for the conventionally harvested saphenous vein). Conclusions Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, only the RA and no‐touch saphenous vein grafts are associated with significantly lower graft occlusion rates. The RA ranks as the best conduit. Registration URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero ; Unique identifier: CRD42020164492.", "document_id": "Paper_20"}

Inventions consist of mechanical structures, production processes, quality improvements of products, and so on. Generally, goods or appliances in everyday life are a result of an invention or product design that has been published in patent documents. A new invention contributes to the standard of living, improves productivity and quality, reduces production costs for industry, or delivers products with higher added value. Patent documents are considered to be excellent sources of knowledge in a particular field of technology, leading to inventions. Technology trend forecasting from patent documents depends on the subjective experience of experts. However, accumulated patent documents consist of a huge amount of text data, making it more difficult for those experts to gain knowledge precisely and promptly. Therefore, technology trend forecasting using objective methods is more feasible. There are many statistical methods applied to patent analysis, for example, technology overview, investment volume, and the technology life cycle. There are also data mining methods by which patent documents can be classified, such as by technical characteristics, to support business decision-making. The main contribution of this study is to apply data mining methods and social network analysis to gain knowledge in emerging technologies and find informative technology trends from patent data. We experimented with our techniques on data retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) website. The technique includes K-means clustering, text mining, and association rule mining methods. The patent data analyzed include the International Patent Classification (IPC) code and patent titles. Association rule mining was applied to find associative relationships among patent data, then combined with social network analysis (SNA) to further analyze technology trends.

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) supported by complementary external evidence. Data sources Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Study selection Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing PFO closure and/or medical therapies in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Review methods We conducted an NMA complemented with external evidence and rated certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results Ten RCTs in eight studies proved eligible (n=4416). Seven RCTs (n=3913) addressed PFO closure versus medical therapy. Of these, three (n=1257) addressed PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy, three (n=2303) addressed PFO closure versus mixed antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies and one (n=353) addressed PFO closure versus anticoagulation. The remaining three RCTs (n=503) addressed anticoagulant versus antiplatelet therapy. PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy probably results in substantial reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence (risk difference per 1000 patients over 5 years (RD): −87, 95% credible interval (CrI) −100 to −33; moderate certainty). Compared with anticoagulation, PFO closure may confer little or no difference in ischaemic stroke recurrence (low certainty) but probably has a lower risk of major bleeding (RD −20, 95% CrI −27 to −2, moderate certainty). Relative to either medical therapy, PFO closure probably increases the risk of persistent atrial fibrillation (RD 18, 95% CI +5 to +56, moderate certainty) and device-related adverse events (RD +36, 95% CI +23 to +50, high certainty). Anticoagulation, compared with antiplatelet therapy, may reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence (RD −71, 95% CrI −100 to +17, low certainty), but probably increases the risk of major bleeding (RD +12, 95% CrI −5 to +65, moderate certainty). Conclusions In patients aged &lt;60 years, PFO closure probably confers an important reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but may make no difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation and device-related adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.

Design/methodology/approach Several methods and approaches are used: a dynamic analysis of a patent citation network to identify technology life cycle phases, patent co-citation network mapping from the patent citation network and the application of link prediction algorithms to the patent co-citation network. Findings The results of the presented study indicate that future knowledge flow within a technology domain can be predicted by predicting patent co-citations using the preferential attachment link prediction algorithm. Furthermore, they indicate that the patent – co-citations occurring between the end of the growth life cycle phase and the start of the maturation life cycle phase contribute the most to the precision of the knowledge flow prediction. Finally, it is demonstrated that most of the predicted knowledge flow occurs in a time period closely following the application of the link – prediction algorithm. Practical implications By having insight into future potential co-citations of patents, a firm can leverage its existing patent portfolio or asses the acquisition value of patents or the companies owning them. Originality/value It is demonstrated that the flow of knowledge in patent co-citation networks follows a rich get richer intuition. Moreover, it is show that the knowledge contained in younger patents has a greater chance of being cited again. Finally, it is demonstrated that these co-citations can be predicted in the short term when the preferential attachment algorithm is applied to a patent co-citation network.", "document_id": "Paper_29"}

Most of the classical information analysis tools can only manage an analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The information analysis tool that will be considered in our study is the MultiSOM tool whose core model represents a significant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays and its inter-map communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data.The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented-analysis as compared to a global analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation.The experimental context of the paper is constituted by a patent database of 1000 patents related to oil engineering. The patents structure and the patents field semantics are firstly exploited in order to generate different viewpoints corresponding to different areas of interest for the analysts. In the experiment the selected viewpoints correspond to uses, advantages, patentees, and titles subfields of the patents. The indexing vocabulary of each viewpoint is automatically extracted of its related textual contents in the patents through a full text analysis. The resulting vocabulary is then used to rebuild patents descriptions regarding each viewpoint. These descriptions are finally classified through the unsupervised MultiSOM algorithm resulting in as much different maps as viewpoints. A fifth \"global viewpoint\" which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global classification mechanism and a pure viewpoint-oriented classification mechanism.", "document_id": "Paper_32"}

Design/methodology/approach Through a negative binomial regression, the work analyses how the characteristics of the openness of the organisation’s innovation process in the period 2004-2010 influence the firm’s patent productivity in the following period (2011-2016). Findings The breadth of the open innovation (OI) process, here measured by the number of external network ties that an organisation realises for the realisation of its patents, has a positive effect on patent productivity. The depth of the openness, that is, the intensity of external network ties, has an equally positive influence on the innovative performance. However, after a tipping point, the patent productivity tends to decrease, underlining the costs and problems of OI practices. Research limitations/implications This study considers only patent collaborations in the city of Florence. Therefore, it focusses on codified innovations and on a single territorial case study. Practical implications The results underline the importance of the adoption of OI practices in restricted geographical contexts (such as cities, clusters or industrial districts) but with several limitations.

We carried out a co-occurrence analysis and a patent analysis using data obtained from the Scopus and Lens databases to provide a general overview of the current state of this area of knowledge. The co-occurrence analysis intends to provide an overview of biorefining and sustainability based on terms associated with these two concepts as a starting point to determine the progress and existing challenges of the field. The results of the patent analysis consisted in identifying the main technological sectors, applicants, and territories where inventions associated with biorefining are registered. The analysis of the information showed that bioeconomy, techno-economic aspects, circular economy, technical issues associated with biomass production, and biofuels represent the focal point of basic research in a wide range of disciplines. Technology development is focused on fermentation, enzymes, and microorganisms, among other areas, which shows the validity of these traditional techniques in addressing the problems faced by the bioeconomy. This scenario shows that developed economies are the driving force behind this area of knowledge and that the PCT system is fundamental for the protection and commercialization of these inventions in places different from where they originated. Furthermore, the challenge lies in learning to work in alternative and complementary technological sectors, beyond microbiology and enzyme applications, in pursuit of the sector’s technical and economic feasibility.", "document_id": "Paper_40"}

The availability of different pharmacotherapeutic options often poses a practical challenge to the practising neonatologist as to which one to choose as a therapeutic option. Our objectives are to determine the relative merits of the available pharmacotherapeutic options for the management of PDA. Methods and Analysis We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of intravenous or oral: indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants. The primary outcome is failure of closure of the PDA. Secondary outcomes are neonatal mortality, need for surgical closure, duration of ventilator support, chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, time to full enteral feeds and oliguria. We will search Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) as well as grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias (ROB) and the confidence in the estimate (with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach). Subgroup analysis according to gestational age, birth weight, different doses of interventions, time of administration of the first dose of the intervention, and echocardiographic definition of haemodynamically significant PDA and ROB are planned. We will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome, if adequate data are available. Ethics and Dissemination The results will help to reduce the uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the interventions, will identify knowledge gaps or will encourage further research for other therapeutic options. Therefore, its results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. On the basis of the nature of its design, no ethics approval is necessary for this study.

We examine two scenarios that are the alternative to each other. The first is what we call the globalization of regional innovation system/weakening of inter‐regional hierarchy scenario: As many regions develop their niches in the global economy, the national “anchor” region loses its relative importance as the importer and distributor of new knowledge, rendering the domestic inter‐regional hierarchy less significant as a result. The second scenario is the globalization of national innovation system/persistence of inter‐regional hierarchy. The nation’s traditional anchor region becomes even more active in importing technology and distributing it to other regions of the country. To test which scenario is closer to reality, we employ social network metrics to analyse inter‐regional technology diffusion networks using Chinese patent licensing data for the 1998–2013 period.

Following the existing literature on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to propose an explorative approach to investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a patent-based multi-level network model that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as an example. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives. The results indicate that the lack of international collaborations among assignees and industry–university–research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the lack of overseas patent applications, especially the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the leading assignees lack awareness of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China’s AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields.", "document_id": "Paper_49"}

Longitudinal patent citation networks in two emerging sectors, the hydrogen energy sector and nano-tech sector have been analysed for a time period from 2004 to 2012, in four diverse developed countries.

This study retrieved relevant studies from 7 databases, and the retrieval time was from the establishment of each database to June 2022. After the screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, 47 studies were finally analyzed, involving 11 Chinese patent medicines. The results demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine intervention was superior to oral western medicine treatment in improving the patient’s condition as assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), effective rate, and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog). Particularly, the effect of Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention was prominent. Meanwhile, Chinese patent medicine intervention in AD did not significantly increase the risk of adverse reactions. The results of the Network Meta-analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine had statistically significant differences in the MMSE score, ADL score, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog score, compared with both western medicine alone and Chinese patent medicine alone. In terms of adverse reactions, the difference between Chinese patent medicine intervention and simple oral western medicine was statistically significant. The results of further ranking probability analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention ranked first in terms of MMSE, ADL, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog. Additionally, oral Chinese patent medicine intervention alone ranked first in reducing adverse reactions. In the funnel plots of the MMSE, ADL, and effective rate, most studies were symmetrically distributed on both sides of the midline, where small sample effects and publication bias might exist to some extent. However, this conclusion still needs to be combined with clinical syndrome differentiation and treatment, and more large-sample, multi-center, high-quality studies are needed for further verification.", "document_id": "Paper_57"}

Subsequently, a collaborative innovation network based on the patent data of green transportation technologies was built and analysed.

The results show that the proposed research framework based on patent data and social network analysis method helps examine the critical nodes and links in the network, as well as their types and characteristics of the collaboration network.

Therefore, this study analyzes SOA patents and constructs a technology network for SOA patents. The results indicate that the critical SOA technologies are mainly used in lasers, semiconductor lasers, light guides, electromagnetic wave transmission communication other than radio-wave communication, and devices controlling light sources. Among the five critical SOA technologies, lasers (H01S3) account for the highest percentage at 22.21%. Consequently, the critical technologies do not focus on specific technology fields but have characteristics of multiple technology fields. In addition, considerable development has occurred in semiconductor lasers in recent years. Finally, patentee analysis indicates that for SOA technologies, the public sector and academia play relatively weak roles in early technology development or following technology development. However, with the rapid development of mobile communication and optical communication, the government of each country can consider investing additional R&amp;D funds and resources in the future.

The first contribution of this work is in the empirical representation of technological change. Following the growing field of research about the use of patent citation networks for mapping technological trajectories, this methodology is applied to the telecommunications switching industry. Furthermore, given the paucity of analytical tools for the analysis of patent citation networks from a technology dynamics perspective, a completely new method is developed. Loosely based on the notion of \"inheritance of genes\", some indicators of cumulativeness of knowledge are developed and used for detecting the emergence of new technologies within a patent citation network. The second contribution is in the tradition of evolutionary economics, that is to provide an in depth case study of industry evolution. In particular, following the Sectoral System of Innovation approach, a chapter of this work is devoted to the analysis of the structural evolution of the telecommunication switching industry. This corresponds to considering the industry long-term development and focusing on several aspects, such as the emergence of new technologies, changes in firms competences and skills, firms’ diversification and integration strategies, and the role of public authorities and institutions. The analysis of the structural evolution intends to enrich the bulk of appreciative theorizing about the co-evolution of technology and industry in an oligopolistic and regulated sector. This thesis includes both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The former mainly consist of the use of secondary sources and empirical data for reconstructing technology, industry, and firm evolution. The latter is carried out analyzing a patent citation network built using patents related to telecommunication switching granted between 1963 and 2001. Part I (chapter 2) introduces the reader to some theoretical issues covered in the thesis and provides the underpinning of what we could call the \"general assumptions\" of the thesis. These are: the theoretical support of an industry level study, the link between technology and industrial dynamics, and a cognitive approach to technical change. Finally, this chapter ends with the explicit stating of the research questions. Part II (chapters 3 and 4) represents a piece of qualitative research that focuses on the technological development and the industry structural evolution. In particular, chapter 3 provides a detailed account of technology evolution in telecommunication switches, whose aim is to highlight the technological history of telecommunication switches and which technological bottlenecks materialized. This chapter argues that technological progress in the industry follows a \"challenge-and-response\" pattern where the main driver appears to be the solution of emerging technical bottlenecks. Furthermore, this chapter also underlines the issue of performance measurement (i.e. service characteristics) stressing the \"not-off-the-shelf\" nature of telecommunication switches and the interoperability to other network infrastructures. Chapter 4 is an account of the structural evolution of the telecommunication switching industry from its infancy until recent years. As this means to consider several aspects both at firm and industry level, the chapter is divided in two parts. In the first part the industry is considered as a whole and for each period five dimensions are systematically discussed. These are: (i) market structure, (ii) barriers to entry, (iii) demand, (iv) relevant actors end their relations, and (v) source of knowledge and technology. In the second part firms are considered individually with special attention to their (common) genealogy, their national context, their technological competences, and their patterns of diversification and specialization. Part III (chapters 5 and 6) centers on the analysis of technology dynamics through the use of patent citation networks. In particular, the analysis tries to couple qualitative and quantitative research, moving beyond just considering patents as a \"count unit\" and considering also their descriptive contents. The analysis focuses on two aspects: (i) mapping the main flow of knowledge within a directed network using the established method proposed by Hummon and Doreian (1989) and (ii) the analysis of the newly introduced concept of knowledge persistence. We could consider these two chapters as an empirical counterpart of chapter 3, as they provide an empirical representation of the technological evolution and of the exploration of the available technological space. The first step of this type of analysis is the re-framing of the history of technology (chapter 3) in the technological paradigms and trajectories framework. This analysis examines the technological advance through the lenses of engineering heuristics and pinpoints what search strategies engineers used over time. In this setting, paradigms can be distinguished by looking at the stability of such heuristics, the need for new technological competences, and the emergence of new technical bottleneck. The second aspect of technology dynamics is knowledge persistence and the long term knowledge flows in the network. A patent citation network represents a system of knowledge generation and transmission (through citations), and this makes possible to identify the most successful patents in spreading their knowledge to later patents. This corresponds to study each patent citation structure from a global network perspective. In chapter 6 this is operationalized by using genetic concepts such as the Mendelian law of genes inheritance. Finally, in Part V, chapter 7 provides a summary of the main findings of this thesis, discusses their implications, and suggests future lines of research. As regarding industry evolution we can conclude that despite several waves of radical technological change this industry displays a \"slow dynamics\". This is rooted in a slow innovation process and adoption through long-term procurement contracts. Furthermore, looking at the major players reveals a large degree of heterogeneity in term of firms internationalization and telecommunication specialization. As regarding the empirical investigation of technology dynamics we can conclude that the proposed method is successful in clustering patents according to different technological paradigms. Furthermore, it emerges that the adaptation of a new radical technology (i.e. packet switching) to the telephony network took place through the intense exploration of a limited part of the available technological space.", "document_id": "Paper_69"}

Methods Relevant literature published until 13 August 2021, was retrieved from six electronic databases. Randomized clinical trials of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice in patients with hyperlipidaemia were included in the review. Network meta‐analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve probability values were used to rank the treatments. Results This study included 47 trials involving 4824 subjects. In terms of reduced total cholesterol levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) had the highest probability of being the most effective formulation, with Simvastatin (66.4%) and Zhibitai (65.4%) ranked second and third, respectively. Xuezhikang also had the highest probability of reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to the greatest extent (SUCRA: 82.6%) with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%) being the second and third choices, respectively. For reduced triglyceride levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 57.6%) in second and third places, respectively. Finally, in terms of improving high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively. Conclusions Xuezhikang was found to have the highest probability of being the most effective formulation for reducing total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while Zhibituo had the highest probability of being the most effective for controlling triglyceride and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The studies included in the review exhibited certain limitations and, therefore, more rigorously designed studies should be performed.

This network meta‐analysis (NMA) was designed to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines combined with chemotherapy for gastric cancer on the National Basic Medical Insurance Drugs List of China. Methods . A comprehensive literature search was performed in seven electronic databases from their inception to February 25, 2020, aiming to collect all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines as an adjuvant for gastric cancer. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Scale. NMA was then performed by using STATA 16.0 software and ADDIS 1.16.8 software. Results . Finally, 30 RCTs were included, involving seven kinds of oral Chinese patent medicines, with a total of 2602 patients. For improvement of clinical efficacy, Bazhen granule combined with chemotherapy was ranked first for effectiveness, followed by the Cinobufacin capsule combined with chemotherapy and Xiao’aiping tablet combined with chemotherapy. Meanwhile, Bazhen granules combined with chemotherapy also were ranked first in reducing gastrointestinal reactions. In terms of improving performance status, the Xiao’aiping tablet was the best and significantly better than other oral Chinese patent medicines. Besides, the Zhenqi Fuzheng granule combined with chemotherapy was best for reducing the incidence of leucopenia. Conclusions . Since only one RCT of Bazhen granule was included in this study for analysis, its statistical efficiency is low. Therefore, this study recommends that the Cinobufacin capsule combined with chemotherapy should be a priority in improving clinical efficacy.

In contrast, we propose that collaboration can have opposite effects at the two extremes: it reduces the probability of very poor outcomes—because of more rigorous selection processes—while simultaneously increasing the probability of extremely successful outcomes—because of greater recombinant opportunity in creative search. Analysis of over half a million patented inventions supports these arguments: Individuals working alone, especially those without affiliation to organizations, are less likely to achieve breakthroughs and more likely to invent particularly poor outcomes. Quantile regressions demonstrate that the effect is more than an upward mean shift. We find partial mediation of the effect of collaboration on extreme outcomes by the diversity of technical experience of team members and by the size of team members' external collaboration networks. Supporting our meta-argument for the importance of examining each tail of the distribution separately, experience diversity helps trim poor outcomes significantly more than it helps create breakthroughs, relative to the effect of external networks.", "document_id": "Paper_78"}

First, the patent data of gene editing technology is collected from Derwent Innovations Index. Secondly, text mining software is adopted to draw a network graph of topic words, combined with Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to construct a weighted adjacency matrix, and Social Network Analysis is used to obtain the degree of centrality of technical topic words. Finally, the technological trends of gene editing technology is explored by identifying the core themes of gene editing, highlighting themes and emerging themes, and some meaningful conclusions are also obtained. Based on the analysis results, this study finds that the development of gene editing technology is limited by factors such as ethics, law and cellular pollution.

It has been reported that combining oral Chinese patent medicines (OCPMs) and Western medicine (WM) could potentially achieve a better effect than WM alone. However, the optimal OCPMs for stable angina remain controversial and merit further empirical research. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid-Medline, Clinical Trials.gov , China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Weipu Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were all searched from inception to 13 March 2022. We employed Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB2) to assess the overall quality of the selected studies. We also used R 4.1.2 and STATA 14.0 software applications to perform network meta-analysis, followed by sensitivity and subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 179 randomized controlled trials with 16,789 patients were included. The selected trials were all assessed as some concerns. OCPMs combined with WM had a better treatment effect than WM alone. In terms of the effective clinical rate, a significant increase was detected for Qishen Yiqi dripping pill (QSYQ)+WM as compared with Shensong Yangxin capsule (SSYX)+WM, Shexiang Baoxin pill (SXBX)+WM, Tongxinluo capsule (TXL)+WM, Xuefu Zhuyu capsule (XFZY)+WM, Qiliqiangxin capsule (QLQX)+WM, Naoxintong capsule (NXT)+WM, Fufang Danshen dripping pill (FFDS)+WM, and Danlou tablet (DL)+WM. QSYQ + WM had the highest-ranking probability (98.12%). Regarding the effective rate in ECG, QSYQ + WM was superior to SXBX + WM, TXL + WM, DL + WM, FFDS + WM, and NXT + WM. QSYQ + WM ranked first (94.21%). In terms of weekly frequency of angina, QLQX + WM obtained a better effect than FFDS + WM, Kuanxiong aerosol (KXQW)+WM, NXT + WM, QLQX + WM, SSYX + WM, SXBX + WM, and TXL + WM. QLQX + WM ranked first (100.00%). Regarding the duration of an angina attack, KXQW + WM was superior to SSYX + WM; KXQW + WM ranked first (95.71%). Adverting to weekly nitroglycerin usage, TXL + WM had the highest-ranking probability (82.12%). Referring to cardiovascular event rate, DL + WM had the highest effect (73.94%). Additionally, SSYX + WM had the lowest rate of adverse drug reactions (1.14%). Conclusion: OCPMs combined with WM had a higher efficacy. QSYQ + WM, QLQX + WM, KXQW + WM, TXL + WM, DL + WM, SSYX + WM, and SXBX + WM merit further investigation. SXBX + WM is presumably the optimal treatment prescription for both clinically effective and cardiovascular event rates. Further high-quality empirical research is needed to confirm the current results.

This paper proposes a systematic and replicable method of patent analysis to identify problems to be solved requisite for sustainable technology planning and development, by implementing the concept of ‘context’ to facilitate problem identification. The main concept of the method entails the importance of the connections between contextual information and problems to provide more focused, relevant, and constructive insights essential for instating goals for research and development activities. These context–problem entities and their entwined connections are discovered using keyword pattern matching, grammar-based text mining, and co-word analysis techniques. The intermediary outputs are then utilized to generate the proposed context–problem network (CP net) for social network, grammar, and quantitative data analysis. For verification, our method was applied to 737 patents in the wireless energy transmission technology domain, successfully yielding CP net data. The detailed analysis of the resulting CP net data delivered meaningful information in the wireless charging technology field: The main contexts, “batteries”, “power transmission coils”, and “cores”, are found to be most relevant to the main problems, “maximizing coupling efficiency”, “minimizing DC signal components”, and “charging batteries”. The results provide a wide range of informative perspectives for individuals, the scientific community, corporate, and market-level stakeholders. Furthermore, the method of this study can be applicable to various technologies since it is independent of specific subject domains.

Since the earliest research using patent data, it was recognized that patents are highly heterogeneous with a minority of patents having much greater impact and value than others. Citation counts are a key measurement of patents, observable directly from patent bibliographic data, which carries information about patent characteristics. But patent citations form a complex network that carries more information about patents than the number of a patent's immediate neighbors.This dissertation explores network measures that exploit this structure to extract more information about patents. The first chapter of this dissertation is addressed to network centrality and the measurement of patent value. The centrality of a patent is negatively related, after controls for citation counts, to public company market value. This establishes that centrality measurements carry information about patent attributes beyond citation counts, and suggests a clear market saturation phenomenon that may drive the result.The next chapter considers whether patent centrality measurements can detect probable holdup in the economic space of patents. Patent pools associated with technical standards, such as the MPEG-2 video compression method, can relate to inventions subject to many competing rights. Centrality measurements are lower for patents that are in the patent pool, suggesting a line of research into the measurement of patent complementarity and substitute relationships.The remaining chapter concerns technology identification from patent citations. Classifying patents by technology is a common necessity in patent empirics, and existing approaches using administrative classification suffer certain inevitable limitations due to the nature of the classification system. Community detection algorithms can use citations to break patents into natural groups. An empirical analysis shows that the communities thus produced contain more information than administrative classifications and can detect underlying technological changes before the classification system does.", "document_id": "Paper_94"}

Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed, Chinese Biomedicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and Chongqing VIP Information databases were comprehensively searched from the beginning to February 2022. Review Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including Bailing capsule (BLC); Jinshuibao capsule (JSB); Huangkui capsule (HKC); Compound Xueshuantong capsule (CXC); uremic clearance granule (UCG); Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT); tripterygium glycosides (TG); Keluoxin capsule (KLX), and Shenshuaining tablet (SSNT) combined with ACEI/ARB for patients with early DKD were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean difference (MD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), we then ranked each therapeutic regime. Results: Ultimately, 160 RCTs involving 13,365 patients and nine CPMs were included. UCG showed significantly higher probabilities on urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) when compared with ACEI/ARB group, with MD of −47 (95%CI) (−57, −37) and SUCRA 98.0%. The CXC group achieved a remarkable improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared with ACEI/ARB (RR, 1.3, 95%CI (1.2, 1.5)) with SUCRA 91.9%. SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of serum creatinine (Scr) (−19 (−26, −12), SUCRA 99.3%) and adverse effects (AEs) (0.46 (0.17, 1.1), SUCRA 82.9%). BLC showed the greatest effectiveness on 24 h urinary total protein (24 h UTP) (−170 (−260, −83), SUCRA 78.5%) and triglyceride (Trig) (−0.89 (−1.2, −0.53), SUCRA 97.0%). From the cost-effectiveness analysis of CPMs in China, the cost of TG, SYKFT and CXC was 108, 600, and 648 RMB, respectively, per 3 months and were ranked in the top three. Conclusion: UCG and CXC might be the optimum selection for improving UAER and ORR, and SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of Scr and AEs.

The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated according to the Cochrane bias risk standard, and the data was analyzed by RevMan 5.3 and Stata/MP 15.1. A total of 11 kinds of Chinese patent medicines in 27 RCTs were included. According to Meta-analysis, in term of the effective rate, Tianmeng Liquid, Zaoren Anshen Capsules, Shumian Capsules, Shensong Yangxin Capsules, Shenqi Wuweizi Tablets, Shugan Jieyu Capsules, Anshen Bunao Liquid and Qiye Anshen Tablets combined with nonbenzodiazepine drugs(NBZDs) were superior to NBZDs alone. In term of the improvement of Pittsburg sleeping quality index(PSQI) score, Tianmeng Liquid, Shumian Capsules, Shensong Yangxin Capsules, Bailemian Capsules, Shenqi Wuweizi Tablets, Shugan Jieyu Capsules, Yangxue Qingnao Granules and Yindan Xinnaotong Capsules combined with NBZDs were superior to NBZDs alone. In terms of the safety, Shumian Capsules, Shensong Yangxin Capsules, Shenqi Wuweizi Tablets and Qiye Anshen Tablets combined with NBZDs were superior to NBZDs alone. In terms of the avoidance of dizziness and headache, Qiye Anshen Tablets combined with NBZDs were superior to NBZDs alone. The results of Network Meta-analysis indicated that in term of the effective rate, top three optimal medication regimens were NBZDs combined with Shugan Jieyu Capsules, combined with Zaoren Anshen Capsules and combined with Shensong Yangxin Capsules in the order from high to low. With the respect of improvement of PSQI score, top three optimal medication regimens were NBZDs combined with Yangxue Qingnao Granules, combined with Tianmeng Liquid and combined with Yindan Xinnaotong Capsules in the order from high to low. In terms of the safety, top three optimal medication regimens were NBZDs combined with Qiye Anshen Tablets, combined with Shensong Yangxin Capsules and combined with Shenqi Wuweizi Tablets in the order from high to low. In terms of the avoidance of dizziness and headache, top three optimal medication regimens were NBZDs combined with Qiye Anshen Tablets, combined with Zaoren Anshen Capsules and combined with Shumian Capsules in the order from high to low. In terms of the avoidance of fatigue, top three optimal medication regimens were NBZDs combined with Shensong Yangxin Capsules, combined with Shumian Capsules and combined with Qiye Anshen Tablets in the order from high to low. In conclusion, Chinese patent medicines combined with NBZDs can effectively alleviate the symptoms of insomnia with a high safety.
