In this context, the present study measures firm‐level technology convergence (TC) capability using patent network analysis. A firm’s TC capabilities are measured using three centrality indices pertaining to a patent network, which is constructed based on the relationship between patents and their international patent classification. For the empirical analysis, panel regression is conducted to observe the effect of TC capabilities on innovation for the top 30 firms in four manufacturing industries. We find that the TC degree positively influences the firms’ overall innovation, namely their total number of patents, and negatively influences their convergent innovation, calculated as the ratio between the number of TC patents and the total number of patents, while the effect of TC betweenness is the opposite. These findings imply that while concentrating on similar technologies may promote quick technology application, it could hamper the enhancement of a TC’s potential. To promote TC, a firm should thus develop technologies more likely to be involved in TC."
Paper_2,Effective patent management is essential for organ...,Paper,"Effective patent management is essential for organizations to maintain their competitive advantage. The classification of patents is a critical part of patent management and industrial analysis. This study proposes a hybrid-patent-classification approach that combines a novel patent-network-based classification method with three conventional classification methods to analyze query patents and predict their classes. The novel patent network contains various types of nodes that represent different features extracted from patent documents. The nodes are connected based on the relationship metrics derived from the patent metadata. The proposed classification method predicts a query patent's class by analyzing all reachable nodes in the patent network and calculating their relevance to the query patent. It then classifies the query patent with a modified k-nearest neighbor classifier. To further improve the approach, we combine it with content-based, citation-based, and metadata-based classification methods to develop a hybrid-classification approach. We evaluate the performance of the hybrid approach on a test dataset of patent documents obtained from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and compare its performance with that of the three conventional methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed patent-network-based approach yields more accurate class predictions than the patent network-based approach."

We focused on finding patterns of convergence within robot technology using network analysis of patents in both the USPTO and KIPO. To identify the variables that affect convergence, we used quadratic assignment procedures (QAP). From our analysis, we observed the patent network ecology related to convergence and found technologies that have great potential to converge with other robotics technologies. The results of our study are expected to contribute to setting up convergence based R&amp;D policies for robotics, which can lead new innovation."

Despite the importance of a quantum ecosystem, current articles barely illustrated its interconnected relations, essential elements and the long-term attributes of developing technologies. We apply the innovation ecosystem and social-technical system theories to bridge such research gaps by realising the patent network analysis. The analytical contents include focal actors, main technological clusters and technological trajectory, and most of them correspond to relevant reports. Particularly, quantum computation is an eye-catching subfield due to its high and intensive knowledge engagements in the past years. Last, we conclude the analytical results and provide two discussions in the discussion & conclusion section as the main contributions. One is to illustrate the long-term attributes and backgrounds of the analytical contents through the lens of the multi-level perspective framework. The other illustrates a path toward a focal actor."

Design/methodology/approach The patent co-class analysis and the patent citation analysis are applied to discover core safety fields and technology, respectively. In specific, three types of network analysis, which are centrality analysis, association rule mining analysis and brokerage network analysis, are applied to measure the individual, synergy and group intensity. Findings The core safety fields derived from three types of network analysis used by different nature of data algorithms are compared with each other to understand distinctive meaning of cores of patent class such as medical safety, working safety and vehicle safety, differentiating network structure. Also, to be specific, the authors find the detailed technology contained in the core patent class using patent citation network analysis. Practical implications The results provide meaningful implications to various stakeholders in organization: safety management, safety engineering and safety policy. The multiple patent network enables safety manager to identify core safety convergence fields and safety engineers to develop new safety technology. Also, in the view of technology convergence, the strategy of safety policy can be expanded to collaboration and open innovation. Originality/value This is the initial study on applying various network analysis algorithms based on patent data (class and citation) for safety management. Through comparison among network analysis techniques, the different results are identified and the collective decision making on finding core of safety technology convergence is supported. The decision maker can obtain the various perspectives of tracing technology convergence."

The results demonstrate that the proposed patent network-based approach outperforms the conventional approaches."
Paper_7,"Patent network analysis, an advanced method of pat...",Paper,"Patent network analysis, an advanced method of patent analysis, is a useful tool for technology management. This method visually displays all the relationships among the patents and enables the analysts to intuitively comprehend the overview of a set of patents in the field of the technology being studied. Although patent network analysis possesses relative advantages different from traditional methods of patent analysis, it is subject to several crucial limitations. To overcome the drawbacks of the current method, this study proposes a novel patent analysis method, called the intelligent patent network analysis method, to make a visual network with great precision. Based on artificial intelligence techniques, the proposed method provides an automated procedure for searching patent documents, extracting patent keywords, and determining the weight of each patent keyword in order to generate a sophisticated visualization of the patent network. This study proposes a detailed procedure for generating an intelligent patent network that is helpful for improving the efficiency and quality of patent analysis. Furthermore, patents in the field of Carbon Nanotube Backlight Unit (CNT-BLU) were analyzed to verify the utility of the proposed method."

We use patent citations networks to study the appropriability efforts that affected the emergence and dynamics of the technological trajectories (TTs) of the genetically modified organisms. Our methodological contribution consists of combining new procedures to identify TTs with the study of the characteristics of scale-free networks. This paper also proposes legal enforcement indicators that attempt to assess the economic importance of patents that make up citation networks. We identify two TTs that include patents on biotech traits and enabling technologies. These patents were both effective in collecting royalties from farmers and deterring potential entrants, particularly through intellectual property (IP) litigation. The results also show that these litigated patents have impacted merger and acquisition activity in seed industry. We conclude that IP lawsuits may have contributed to delaying the R&amp;D investments of new entrants, thus preserving the monopolistic position enjoyed by the pioneering company and restricting the scope of crop innovations."

However, to date, only a few attempts have been made at the patent analysis of cloud computing. The main contribution of this research is to propose a two-stage retrieval strategy and a systematic method for conducting patent network analysis on cloud computing. By conducting bibliometric and network analyses, we show that a two-stage patent retrieval method can successfully identify patents belonging to cloud computing. The effectiveness of the proposed systematic method for patent network analysis is proved through gray relational-based cluster analysis. With the aid of visual networks and technology centrality indexes, this study seeks to reveal the overall patent structure and identify the key technologies of cloud computing. The results of this study can provide a valuable reference for enterprises intending to enter the cloud computing industry."

The results show that on the whole, the network accessibility of GINs has continuously improved, showing scale‐free network characteristics. The important nodes in the network are mainly developed countries such as Europe and the United States, and the node polarization effect has weakened; the network has four agglomeration subgroups. The phenomenon of subgroups and factions is not obvious. Further factor identification shows that economic factors and technological information factors have the strongest correlation with the innovation network and that demographic factors have a weaker correlation with the innovation network. In addition, China's position in the innovation network has been increasing year by year, and the role of ‘transit stations’ has become increasingly prominent."

Co-occurrence networks of international patent classification (IPC) codes have been analyzed based on the photovoltaic patents in South Korea during a 15-year period (2002–2016). The results reveal that, while the strength of technology fusion has greatly increased during the period, the structural pattern of fusion has been diversified or decentralized. In the early stage, widespread emergence of new technologies has been observed but, in the later stage, the focus of fusion shifted to the utilization of existing technologies. The characteristics of key technologies also changed as the technology fusion progressed. In the early stage, product technologies such as materials and components played a central role, while operation technologies such as monitor, structure, and arrangement were the drivers of fusion during the later stage."

This paper presents a method to position nations’ efforts in a technology domain. The method builds a network of International Patent Classifications (IPCs) based on their co-occurrence in patent applications and applies an index called the Revealed Patent Application Advantage (RPAA), which reflects where nations’ efforts have been spent in a technology domain denoted as the IPC network. We applied the proposed method to position the efforts that have been spent in the electric vehicle (EV) technology domain by mainland China, Germany, Japan, and the United States."

We posit that since institutions and labor networks vary by region, there should be regional variations in the localization of spillovers. We investigate the relationship between the mobility of major patent holders and the localization of technological knowledge through the analysis of patent citations of important semiconductor innovations. We find that knowledge localization is specific to only certain regions (particularly Silicon Valley) and that the degree of localization varies across regions. By analyzing data on the interfirm mobility of patent holders, we empirically show that the interfirm mobility of engineers influences the local transfer of knowledge. The flow of knowledge is embedded in regional labor networks."

Since modern technology has become more and more complex and dynamic, general statistical techniques can hardly capture the underlying information of technological interconnection in the process of technology evolution. However, complex network analysis can be considered to be a powerful tool to investigate this issue. At the same time, patent documents containing rich information to indicate technological evolution in sequential time period can be a significant data source. This paper, based on the core terms derived from patent documents, constructs technological networks, to present the distribution of technologies. The comparison between the networks in sequential time periods can not only provide a way to understand technological evolution in detail, but also forecast technology opportunities, which can be used to help understand the development of selected technologies quickly and provide insights to research and development (R&D) plan and technological commercialization. A case study on exploring the evolution of China's artificial intelligence technologies is conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this method."

Cloud computing is among the key technologies in the scope of IOT. In this paper, we choose related patents of cloud computing technology between 1963-2014 from the Derwent Innovations Index database. We extract research technology-related patents of cloud computing, comprehensive utilization of patented metrology research methods and analysis of complex networks. Results show that China has a small number of R&D personnel, and there is no breakdown of the unique and leading technology, while the U.S. Companies have relatively strong R&D capabilities. It indicates us to reduce the gap between China and the U.S. In the development of cloud computing technology. China should promote the development and application of the core technology of cloud computing as soon as possible."

A key goal is to achieve a tradeoff between economy of scope from product variety and economy of scale from platform sharing. Traditionally, product platform planning uses heuristic and manual approaches and relies almost solely on expertise and intuition. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to draw the boundary of a platform-system, complementing the other platform design approaches and assisting designers in the architecting process. The method generates a network of functions through relationships of their co-occurrences in prior designs of a product or systems domain and uses a network analysis algorithm to identify an optimal core–periphery structure. Functions identified in the network core co-occur cohesively and frequently with one another in prior designs, and thus, are suggested for inclusion in the potential platform to be shared across a variety of product-systems with peripheral functions. We apply the method to identify the platform functions for the application domain of spherical rolling robots (SRRs), based on patent data."

Patents and scientific publications are examined over the period 2004–2014 to capture recent trends and patterns of collaborative innovation activities among UIG actors in China and South Korea. The analysis has been carried out from a triple helix perspective, investigating the structure and dynamics of the Sino-Korea scientific and technological collaborations. The result reveals an imbalance between science and technology in knowledge dynamics and the different extent and intensity of collaborative efforts of the two countries. Based on comparative analysis of co-authorship and co-inventorship networks, the scale and density of scientific collaboration networks appear much higher than those of the technological counterpart. In fact, the technological collaboration between China and Korea is not common in patents and its network needs to be further strengthened. Implications for both China and Korea of future collaborative relationships are discussed."

Applying network analysis to a USPTO database containing Latin American inventors, we build and analyse collaboration networks in the process of invention and knowledge appropriation. The structural properties and the evolution of such networks allow us to measure critical attributes of the Latin American innovation systems. Specifically, the networks exhibit low absorptive capacity and high external openness, which are critical linkages with external nodes in the network growth process. We identify different trajectories of innovation systems within the region, analysing specific paths of capability (de)accumulation and network maturity against the backdrop of national development trajectories."

We used topic modelling based on latent Dirichlet allocation analysis to identify underlying topics in sub-areas in the field. We also used social network analysis to measure the centrality indices of publication keywords to detect important and influential sub-areas and used co-occurrence analysis of keywords to visualise relationships among subfields. The research result is useful to identify evolving topics and areas of current focus in the field of humanoid technology. The results contribute to identify valuable research patterns from publications and to increase understanding of the hidden knowledge themes that are revealed by patents.

All of the published studies, however, have performed pairwise comparisons and a comprehensive evaluation of the patency rates of all conduits has yet to be published. We set out to investigate the angiographic patency rates of all conduits used in coronary bypass surgery by performing a network meta‐analysis of the current available randomized evidence. Methods and Results A systematic literature search was conducted for randomized controlled trials comparing the angiographic patency rate of the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, the no‐touch saphenous vein, the radial artery (RA), the right internal thoracic artery, or the gastroepiploic artery. The primary outcome was graft occlusion. A total of 4160 studies were retrieved of which 14 were included with 3651 grafts analyzed. The weighted mean angiographic follow‐up was 5.1 years. Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, both the RA (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35–0.82) and the no‐touch saphenous vein (IRR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.78) were associated with lower graft occlusion. The RA ranked as the best conduit (rank score for RA 0.87 versus 0.85 for no‐touch saphenous vein, 0.23 for right internal thoracic artery, 0.29 for gastroepiploic artery, and 0.25 for the conventionally harvested saphenous vein). Conclusions Compared with the conventionally harvested saphenous vein, only the RA and no‐touch saphenous vein grafts are associated with significantly lower graft occlusion rates. The RA ranks as the best conduit. Registration URL: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero ; Unique identifier: CRD42020164492."

On the other side, natural language processing and network analysis researchers is to provide a novel method for mapping technologies and their relations over time, in order to identify dynamic patterns of convergence and to test it on the C4ISTAR field, a defense-related cross-technological field. The methodology automatically extracts technologies from a corpus of scientific papers, policy documents, websites, and company reports using Named Entity Recognition approaches. These technologies are then retrieved from the second corpus of more than 300 thousand patents related to the C4ISTAR domain, measuring their cooccurrences over time. Finally, using the time-varying network analysis, we were able to identify and measure the pattern of technological convergence."

In this paper, we collect extensive information on patents and citations and provide a perspective of citation network analysis of patents from a statistical viewpoint. We identify and analyze the most cited patents, the most innovative and the highly cited companies along with the structural properties of the network by providing in-depth descriptive analysis. Furthermore, we employ Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to analyze the citation networks. ERGMs enables understanding the social perspectives of a patent citation network which has not been studied earlier. We demonstrate that social properties such as homophily (the inclination to cite patents from the same country or in the same language) and transitivity (the inclination to cite references’ references) together with the technicalities of the patents ( e.g., language, categories), has a significant effect on citations. We also provide an in-depth analysis of citations for sectors in patents and how it is affected by the size of the same. Overall, our paper delves into European patents with the aim of providing new insights and serves as an account for fitting ERGMs on large networks and analyzing them. ERGMs help us model network mechanisms directly, instead of acting as a proxy for unspecified dependence and relationships among the observations."

The IoT is about to change how we live and how we work. It is essential to have a perspective on this technology's innovation path to creating more novel applications. Due to increasing Internet connectivity through smartphones, IoT is expected to be an all-pervasive technology, and lately, its patents have grown significantly. Patents contain valuable information, especially including the path of utilizing IoT in different fields. Patent analysis provides valuable information about innovation in IoT technology. This article performs a patent analysis based on the international patent classification (IPC) co-occurrence network in different patents. This network is analyzed by social network analysis (SNA) algorithms. In addition, the most critical nodes are identified by SNA measures and the TOPSIS method. The findings illustrate the structure of the innovation path of IoT, and they will help create more applications and combinations of IoT with other fields. These results provide a guideline that shows how steps for innovation should start."
Paper_24,A patent is an important document issued by the go...,Paper,"A patent is an important document issued by the government to protect inventions or product design. Inventions consist of mechanical structures, production processes, quality improvements of products, and so on. Generally, goods or appliances in everyday life are a result of an invention or product design that has been published in patent documents. A new invention contributes to the standard of living, improves productivity and quality, reduces production costs for industry, or delivers products with higher added value. Patent documents are considered to be excellent sources of knowledge in a particular field of technology, leading to inventions. Technology trend forecasting from patent documents depends on the subjective experience of experts. However, accumulated patent documents consist of a huge amount of text data, making it more difficult for those experts to gain knowledge precisely and promptly. Therefore, technology trend forecasting using objective methods is more feasible. There are many statistical methods applied to patent analysis, for example, technology overview, investment volume, and the technology life cycle. There are also data mining methods by which patent documents can be classified, such as by technical characteristics, to support business decision-making. The main contribution of this study is to apply data mining methods and social network analysis to gain knowledge in emerging technologies and find informative technology trends from patent data. We experimented with our techniques on data retrieved from the European Patent Office (EPO) website. The technique includes K-means clustering, text mining, and association rule mining methods. The patent data analyzed include the International Patent Classification (IPC) code and patent titles. Association rule mining was applied to find associative relationships among patent data, then combined with social network analysis (SNA) to further analyze technology trends. SNA provided metric measurements to explore the most influential technology as well as visualize data in various network layouts. The results showed emerging technology clusters, their meaningful patterns, and a network structure, and suggested information for the development of technologies and inventions."

Design Systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) supported by complementary external evidence. Data sources Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Study selection Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) addressing PFO closure and/or medical therapies in patients with PFO and cryptogenic stroke. Review methods We conducted an NMA complemented with external evidence and rated certainty of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results Ten RCTs in eight studies proved eligible (n=4416). Seven RCTs (n=3913) addressed PFO closure versus medical therapy. Of these, three (n=1257) addressed PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy, three (n=2303) addressed PFO closure versus mixed antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies and one (n=353) addressed PFO closure versus anticoagulation. The remaining three RCTs (n=503) addressed anticoagulant versus antiplatelet therapy. PFO closure versus antiplatelet therapy probably results in substantial reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence (risk difference per 1000 patients over 5 years (RD): −87, 95% credible interval (CrI) −100 to −33; moderate certainty). Compared with anticoagulation, PFO closure may confer little or no difference in ischaemic stroke recurrence (low certainty) but probably has a lower risk of major bleeding (RD −20, 95% CrI −27 to −2, moderate certainty). Relative to either medical therapy, PFO closure probably increases the risk of persistent atrial fibrillation (RD 18, 95% CI +5 to +56, moderate certainty) and device-related adverse events (RD +36, 95% CI +23 to +50, high certainty). Anticoagulation, compared with antiplatelet therapy, may reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence (RD −71, 95% CrI −100 to +17, low certainty), but probably increases the risk of major bleeding (RD +12, 95% CrI −5 to +65, moderate certainty). Conclusions In patients aged &lt;60 years, PFO closure probably confers an important reduction in ischaemic stroke recurrence compared with antiplatelet therapy alone but may make no difference compared with anticoagulation. PFO closure incurs a risk of persistent atrial fibrillation and device-related adverse events. Compared with alternatives, anticoagulation probably increases major bleeding.

Design/methodology/approach Several methods and approaches are used: a dynamic analysis of a patent citation network to identify technology life cycle phases, patent co-citation network mapping from the patent citation network and the application of link prediction algorithms to the patent co-citation network. Findings The results of the presented study indicate that future knowledge flow within a technology domain can be predicted by predicting patent co-citations using the preferential attachment link prediction algorithm. Furthermore, they indicate that the patent – co-citations occurring between the end of the growth life cycle phase and the start of the maturation life cycle phase contribute the most to the precision of the knowledge flow prediction. Finally, it is demonstrated that most of the predicted knowledge flow occurs in a time period closely following the application of the link – prediction algorithm. Practical implications By having insight into future potential co-citations of patents, a firm can leverage its existing patent portfolio or asses the acquisition value of patents or the companies owning them. Originality/value It is demonstrated that the flow of knowledge in patent co-citation networks follows a rich get richer intuition. Moreover, it is show that the knowledge contained in younger patents has a greater chance of being cited again. Finally, it is demonstrated that these co-citations can be predicted in the short term when the preferential attachment algorithm is applied to a patent co-citation network."

Furthermore, they built a network to analyze the influence of small-world properties, as well as the impact of the largest component on the patent value of innovation activities at a corporate level. In this article, the authors conduct an empirical investigation of university–industry patent innovation collaboration in the nano-biopharmaceutical field and propose that their research be considered as new evidence in addition to the previously published literature in this field. Given the pre-existing high skew of patent values in relation to registered patents, they used weighted patent value in the measurement of university–industry innovation performance, rather than simple patent counts.Results: The results show that small-world structures have a parabolical influence on patent innovation performance at corporate level.Findings: The findings go beyond previous research results and can contribute to policy formulation and relevant entrepreneurial decisions in the establishment of university–industry collaboration."
Paper_32,The main area of this paper concerns the neural me...,Paper,"The main area of this paper concerns the neural methods for mapping scientific and technical information (articles, patents) and for assisting a user in carrying out the complex process of analysing large quantities of such information.In the procedure of information analysis, like in the domain of patent analysis, the complexity of the studied topics and the accuracy of the question to be answered may often lead the analyst to partition his reasoning into viewpoints. Most of the classical information analysis tools can only manage an analysis of the studied domain in a global way. The information analysis tool that will be considered in our study is the MultiSOM tool whose core model represents a significant extension of the classical Kohonen SOM neural model. The MultiSOM neural-based tool introduces the concepts of viewpoints and dynamics into the information analysis with its multi-maps displays and its inter-map communication process. The dynamic information exchange between maps can be exploited by an analyst in order to perform cooperative deduction between several different analyzes that have been performed on the same data.The paper demonstrates the efficiency of a viewpoint-oriented-analysis as compared to a global analysis in the domain of patents. Both objective and subjective quality criteria are taken into account for quality evaluation.The experimental context of the paper is constituted by a patent database of 1000 patents related to oil engineering. The patents structure and the patents field semantics are firstly exploited in order to generate different viewpoints corresponding to different areas of interest for the analysts. In the experiment the selected viewpoints correspond to uses, advantages, patentees, and titles subfields of the patents. The indexing vocabulary of each viewpoint is automatically extracted of its related textual contents in the patents through a full text analysis. The resulting vocabulary is then used to rebuild patents descriptions regarding each viewpoint. These descriptions are finally classified through the unsupervised MultiSOM algorithm resulting in as much different maps as viewpoints. A fifth ""global viewpoint"" which represent the combination of all the specific ones is also considered in order to perform our comparison between a global classification mechanism and a pure viewpoint-oriented classification mechanism."

This paper extracts implicit collaborative information and introduces Social Network Analysis (SNA) method to conduct the patentometric analysis based on patent data from the “Top 500 Chinese Construction Enterprises” sourced from PatSnap database. The enterprise-enterprise networks and enterprise-university networks are analyzed quantitatively. The results reveal that: 1) there is a rising trend in the number of patents and patentees; 2) state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in patent development; 3) most of patents are classified as International Patent Classification E04G21; 4) the cooperative relationships are mainly within enterprises and their subsidiaries; 5) when enterprises choose to cooperate with universities, in addition to professional qualification, geographical factors should also be considered. Finally, the development and patent evolution trends are discussed. Some useful suggestions are proposed. The contribution lies in: (a) providing a visualization of the implicit collaboration information of patents in Chinese construction enterprises; (b) revealing cooperative patterns of construction enterprises on patents; and (c) providing enterprises some useful suggestions for patent cooperation."

In terms of techniques for patent analysis, citation analysis has been the most frequently adopted tool. In this research, we note that citation analysis is subject to some crucial drawbacks and propose a network-based analysis, an alternative method for citation analysis. By using an illustrative data set, the overall process of developing patent network is described. The main objective is to understand that the knowledge diffuse between institution and countries. The knowledge diffusion networks are described by using critical node, core network, and network measures analysis .This includes identifying key influential players, the knowledge spillover patterns among them, and the overall knowledge spillover efficiency. The proposed framework is applied to the field of liquid crystal display (LCD), including the patent citation networks of assignee and countries. The analysis shows that the Japan is the most important citation center in LCD research and the LG Phillps LCD, Sharp Samsung, Hitachi, IBM, and AUO are central points of knowledge flow."

This technique is considered a shortcut for developing countries since it can significantly accelerate their technology development. Therefore, as an inevitable process, patent analysis can be utilized to monitor rival companies and diverse industries. In this research, a graph representation learning approach employed to create, analyze and find similarities of the patents data registered in the Iranian Official Gazette. The patent records were scrapped and wrangled through the Iranian Official Gazette portal. Afterward, the key entities were extracted from the scrapped patents dataset to create the Iranian patents graph from scratch based on novel natural language processing and entity resolution technique. Finally, thanks to the utilization of novel graph algorithms and text mining methods, we identified new areas of industry and research from Iranian patent data, which can be used extensively to prevent duplicate patents, familiarity with similar and connected inventions, Awareness of legal entities supporting patents and knowledge of researchers and linked stakeholders in a particular research field."

In particular, global mobile firms focus on technological competition when jostling for market position in recognition of the strategic need to secure a strong mobile platform. In this paper, we analyse the network structure of technological knowledge flows in mobile ecosystems using US patent citation information. We find that two subsectors, platform providers and application and software providers, are at the centre of knowledge exchange activity and play a brokerage role as the key knowledge mediator. Then, we categorise mobile firms into five different groups based on the patterns of their network centrality: knowledge keystone players, knowledge-distributing mediators, knowledge-absorbing mediators, catch-up players, and pure knowledge receivers. The categorisation of firms demonstrates that knowledge flows in the mobile industry converge towards a few leading firms, and such patterns are shaping the mobile ecosystem with respect to technological knowledge. The firms categorised as catch-up players have played a brokerage role within their group, while the firms categorised as knowledge keystone players play a brokerage role across different groups."
Paper_38,Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigat...,Paper,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relational dynamics for innovation and, in particular, the impact of the openness of innovation process on the innovation capacity of organisations in restricted geographical contexts. Design/methodology/approach Through a negative binomial regression, the work analyses how the characteristics of the openness of the organisation’s innovation process in the period 2004-2010 influence the firm’s patent productivity in the following period (2011-2016). Findings The breadth of the open innovation (OI) process, here measured by the number of external network ties that an organisation realises for the realisation of its patents, has a positive effect on patent productivity. The depth of the openness, that is, the intensity of external network ties, has an equally positive influence on the innovative performance. However, after a tipping point, the patent productivity tends to decrease, underlining the costs and problems of OI practices. Research limitations/implications This study considers only patent collaborations in the city of Florence. Therefore, it focusses on codified innovations and on a single territorial case study. Practical implications The results underline the importance of the adoption of OI practices in restricted geographical contexts (such as cities, clusters or industrial districts) but with several limitations. Only collaborating more with others does not foster the organisation’s invention productivity, but different types of evidence are found here. Originality/value An original database has been created, containing all the information on patents realised in the area of Florence from 2004 until 2016, and a social networks analysis was applied to identify the local innovation networks."

Paper_40,Biorefineries are modern mechanisms used for produ...,Paper,"Biorefineries are modern mechanisms used for producing value-added products and biofuels from different biomass sources. However, a crucial challenge is to achieve a sustainable model for their adequate implementation. Challenges related to technical efficiency and economic feasibility are two of the most relevant problems. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the current trends in basic research and technological development around biorefining and sustainability. We carried out a co-occurrence analysis and a patent analysis using data obtained from the Scopus and Lens databases to provide a general overview of the current state of this area of knowledge. The co-occurrence analysis intends to provide an overview of biorefining and sustainability based on terms associated with these two concepts as a starting point to determine the progress and existing challenges of the field. The results of the patent analysis consisted in identifying the main technological sectors, applicants, and territories where inventions associated with biorefining are registered. The analysis of the information showed that bioeconomy, techno-economic aspects, circular economy, technical issues associated with biomass production, and biofuels represent the focal point of basic research in a wide range of disciplines. Technology development is focused on fermentation, enzymes, and microorganisms, among other areas, which shows the validity of these traditional techniques in addressing the problems faced by the bioeconomy. This scenario shows that developed economies are the driving force behind this area of knowledge and that the PCT system is fundamental for the protection and commercialization of these inventions in places different from where they originated. Furthermore, the challenge lies in learning to work in alternative and complementary technological sectors, beyond microbiology and enzyme applications, in pursuit of the sector’s technical and economic feasibility."

The literature on the evolution of technologies and their underlying knowledge bases suggests that technological innovation takes place in an incremental and cumulative manner along certain trajectories. We extend this literature by not only focusing on the influence of the design hierarchy on the evolution of knowledge, but also the influence of emergence of use environments. We focus on the case of lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology from 1970 to 2018. We use a dataset of 101,620 patent families to identify and analyze the LIB industry’s core knowledge trajectory. Our results indicate that the emergence of new use environments (in particular, those that require different service characteristics as compared to older use environments) can serve as an important mechanism for increased knowledge generation at the level of the product architecture, increased product innovation, increased technological uncertainty, and increased participation of new actors in the core knowledge trajectory. We discuss implications for practitioners and policy makers interested in understanding factors that influence the relative knowledge positions of firms and nations in complex, multi-purpose technologies."

The availability of different pharmacotherapeutic options often poses a practical challenge to the practising neonatologist as to which one to choose as a therapeutic option. Our objectives are to determine the relative merits of the available pharmacotherapeutic options for the management of PDA. Methods and Analysis We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of intravenous or oral: indomethacin, ibuprofen and acetaminophen for the treatment of PDA in preterm infants. The primary outcome is failure of closure of the PDA. Secondary outcomes are neonatal mortality, need for surgical closure, duration of ventilator support, chronic lung disease, intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotising enterocolitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, time to full enteral feeds and oliguria. We will search Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) as well as grey literature resources. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias (ROB) and the confidence in the estimate (with Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach). Subgroup analysis according to gestational age, birth weight, different doses of interventions, time of administration of the first dose of the intervention, and echocardiographic definition of haemodynamically significant PDA and ROB are planned. We will perform a Bayesian network meta-analysis to combine the pooled direct and indirect treatment effect estimates for each outcome, if adequate data are available. Ethics and Dissemination The results will help to reduce the uncertainty about the safety and effectiveness of the interventions, will identify knowledge gaps or will encourage further research for other therapeutic options. Therefore, its results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. On the basis of the nature of its design, no ethics approval is necessary for this study.

The 5G network combined with blockchain technology just meets this demand, so it is driving a rapidly growing volume of patent applications. This study proposes application scenarios, architecture diagrams, and patent analysis methods for blockchain-based 5G network technologies, beginning with a network architecture using mobile edge computing (MEC) and blockchain as independent platform components to solve MEC load pressure. In the patent analysis, a patent cluster map of blockchain-based 5G networks is proposed to analyze the intersection of technical application fields. The bottleneck period of technological development is presented for leading countries and enterprises in the technological development of blockchain-based 5G network, highlighting relative advantages and disadvantages. Specifically, to extract the core international patent classification (IPC) key technologies and their mutual interrelatedness, we use network topology analysis to establish an IPC network topology diagram through node global and local topology characteristics, thus revealing hotspots of IPC technology research and the characteristics of the technology relationship system. The findings provide a very useful reference for the formulation of government strategy to assist in the implementation and development of blockchain-based 5G network technologies for future smart cities."

As an objective and quantitative network-based method, main path analysis identifies important patent, structural backbone and development trajectories in the blockchain development. This provides a reference for the scientific communities to understand the current state of blockchain technology, thereby illuminating future research."

Especially, the characteristics and source of R&D funding take critical roles for academic researches to be commercialized. This study aims to investigate the differences depending on R&D funding sources - private or governmental - and to formulate the research policy based on empirical results. From a qualitative perspective, we visualize two-mode networks by linking patent and industry codes. From a quantitative perspective, we conduct ANOVA using centrality indices calculated from the network graphs. Overall, we found idiosyncratic patterns in the technology (patent) - industry networks. However, we only observed marginal differences between the two groups. Furthermore, results of the ANOVA showed a difference in closeness centrality between the two groups. We suggest the policy directions which emphasize interdisciplinary researches and strengthen technology's accessibility to industry."

We examine two scenarios that are the alternative to each other. The first is what we call the globalization of regional innovation system/weakening of inter‐regional hierarchy scenario: As many regions develop their niches in the global economy, the national “anchor” region loses its relative importance as the importer and distributor of new knowledge, rendering the domestic inter‐regional hierarchy less significant as a result. The second scenario is the globalization of national innovation system/persistence of inter‐regional hierarchy. The nation’s traditional anchor region becomes even more active in importing technology and distributing it to other regions of the country. To test which scenario is closer to reality, we employ social network metrics to analyse inter‐regional technology diffusion networks using Chinese patent licensing data for the 1998–2013 period. Our findings support the second scenario, showing that the influence of the traditional anchor region persists in the hierarchical network structure as new cities enter the network. We found five anchor regions: the three usual suspects—Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen—plus two that were slightly less expected—Dongguan and Suzhou."

Transferred patents apply to IP-R&D of received companies. In particularly, companies actively carrying out technology transfer construct a patent portfolio strategy through it. Recently, companies that building patent portfolio strategy explore similar technologies to protect theirs. In past, a qualitative method has been used for the above process. However, the method consumes a lot of time and money. Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to discover patents similar to each other by using data mining. Also visualizing the patent portfolio strategy through the information of those patents. To do this, we collected Google's patents for conducting a case study. Collected patents were projected onto a semantic space through a distributed representation of documents. It then used the distance information of the projected patents to draw the network. As a result, it was possible to visualize Google's patent portfolio strategy."
Paper_49,"In recent years, assessing patent risks has attrac...",Paper,"In recent years, assessing patent risks has attracted fast-growing attention from both researchers and practitioners in studies of technological innovation. Following the existing literature on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to propose an explorative approach to investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a patent-based multi-level network model that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take artificial intelligence (AI) as an example. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives. The results indicate that the lack of international collaborations among assignees and industry–university–research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the lack of overseas patent applications, especially the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the leading assignees lack awareness of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China’s AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields."

We claim social network analysis is a promising tool for empirically investigating the structure and evolution of inter-organizational interaction and knowledge flows within and across regions. However, the potential of the application of network methodology to regional issues is far from exhausted. The aim of our paper is twofold. The first objective is to shed light on the untapped potential of social network analysis techniques in economic geography: we set out some theoretical challenges concerning the static and dynamic analysis of networks in geography. Basically, we claim that network analysis has a huge potential to enrich the literature on clusters, regional innovation systems and knowledge spillovers. The second objective is to describe how these challenges can be met through the application of network analysis techniques, using primary (survey) and secondary (patent) data. We argue that the choice between these two types of data has strong implications for the type of research questions that can be dealt with in economic geography, such as the feasibility of dynamic network analysis."

However, the patent analysis methods based on statistics and machine learning have been introduced recently. In this paper, we proposed a statistical method for quantitative patent analysis. Moreover, we selected drone technology as the target technology for patent analysis. To understand drone technology, we analyzed the patents on drone technology. We searched the patent documents related to drone technology and transformed them to structured data using text mining techniques. First, we visualized the patent keywords to identify the technological structure of a drone. Next, using Bayesian additive regression trees, we analyzed the structured patent data to construct technology scenarios for drones. To illustrate the performance and validity of our proposed research, we presented the experimental results of patent analysis using patent documents related to drone technology."

It is also clear from the literature that not all knowledge has the same value. However, too often in economic geography and cognate fields we have been obsessed with counting knowledge inputs and outputs rather than assessing the quality of knowledge produced. In this article we measure the complexity of knowledge, we map the distribution and the evolution of knowledge complexity in US cities, and we explore how the spatial diffusion of knowledge is linked to complexity. Our knowledge complexity index rests on the bimodal network models of Hidalgo and Hausmann. Analysis is based on more than two million patent records from the US Patent and Trademark Office that identify the technological structure of US metropolitan areas in terms of the patent classes in which they are most active between 1975 and 2010. We find that knowledge complexity is unevenly distributed across the United States and that cities with the most complex technological structures are not necessarily those with the highest rates of patenting. Citation data indicate that more complex patents are less likely to be cited than less complex patents when citing and cited patents are located in different metropolitan areas."

Yet empirical studies of their evolution and evidence of their benefits remain scarce. We develop and exploit a novel database on patent coauthorship to investigate the effects of collaboration networks on innovation. Our analysis reveals the existence of regional small-world structures and the emergence and disappearance of giant components in patent collaboration networks. Using statistical models, we test and fail to find evidence that small-world structure (cohesive clusters connected by occasional nonlocal ties) enhances innovative productivity within geographic regions. We do find that both shorter path lengths and larger connected components correlate with increased innovation. We discuss the implications of our findings for future social network research and theory as well as regional innovation policies."

Thus, this study used academic patents involved in international technology transfer as a basis for analysis and attempted to identify technological hotspots through a technological structure network analysis. The results indicated that key technologies in academic patent–based international technology transfer networks were mainly concentrated on measurement, nanotechnology, medical technology, biotechnology, and electric digital data processing. An academic patent technological hotspot network model was established to serve as a reference for academic technology transfers as well as for governments in their promotion of emerging technologies."

Scholars have focused on these regarding networking phenomena: the effects of national and sectoral factors. In spite of their theoretical contributions, attempts have been neglected in identifying and/or linking the factors from both national and sectoral innovation systems within the networks. This paper examines the cross-country differences within a sector, and the cross-sectoral differences within a country, as the consequences of sectoral–national intersections. Longitudinal patent citation networks in two emerging sectors, the hydrogen energy sector and nano-tech sector have been analysed for a time period from 2004 to 2012, in four diverse developed countries. The results convey that the two sectors demonstrate significantly varied networking activities, notably influenced by national capability orientations. On the other hand, cross-country differences in networking activities are also varied by technological path dependence."

This study retrieved relevant studies from 7 databases, and the retrieval time was from the establishment of each database to June 2022. After the screening, data extraction, and quality assessment, 47 studies were finally analyzed, involving 11 Chinese patent medicines. The results demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine intervention was superior to oral western medicine treatment in improving the patient’s condition as assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), effective rate, and Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog). Particularly, the effect of Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention was prominent. Meanwhile, Chinese patent medicine intervention in AD did not significantly increase the risk of adverse reactions. The results of the Network Meta-analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine had statistically significant differences in the MMSE score, ADL score, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog score, compared with both western medicine alone and Chinese patent medicine alone. In terms of adverse reactions, the difference between Chinese patent medicine intervention and simple oral western medicine was statistically significant. The results of further ranking probability analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention ranked first in terms of MMSE, ADL, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog. Additionally, oral Chinese patent medicine intervention alone ranked first in reducing adverse reactions. In the funnel plots of the MMSE, ADL, and effective rate, most studies were symmetrically distributed on both sides of the midline, where small sample effects and publication bias might exist to some extent. However, this conclusion still needs to be combined with clinical syndrome differentiation and treatment, and more large-sample, multi-center, high-quality studies are needed for further verification."

Collaboration innovations covering kinds of participating entities and various linked relationships have become one of the critical drivers for the transportation sector. Some researchers have analysed the collaborative innovation of scientific literature in this field. However, fewer studies have investigated the current performance of collaborative technology innovation represented by patents in the transportation sector. In this context, a research framework based on the social network analysis approach is proposed for collaboration green transportation technologies. The purpose of the research is to establish an analytical framework for the green transportation innovation network and seek the key collaboration activities and strategies. Subsequently, a collaborative innovation network based on the patent data of green transportation technologies was built and analysed. Especially, the innovation entities in the collaboration network are divided into four groups: business enterprises, individuals, universities, and research institutions, so that more detailed information in the network could be obtained. The results show that the proposed research framework based on patent data and social network analysis method helps examine the critical nodes and links in the network, as well as their types and characteristics of the collaboration network. The increasing number of green transportation technologies shows active cooperation in this field. The study also found that business enterprises node gradually plays a major role in cooperative innovation. The corresponding policy recommendations are also provided."

Using firm network data based on a joint patent from 1980 to 2015, this study reveals that firms participate in collaborative innovation primarily to complement their technological resources. Also, the collaborative innovation network among Korean ICT firms has evolved mainly by homophily mechanisms and has limited expandability. The findings suggest that the government can promote SMEs’ participation in collaborative innovation by concentrating on supporting the development of technological capabilities."

The essential patents declared by members of the SSOs play a critical role in such standardization processes. Some former researchers have found that, when using network analysis for measuring the knowledge positions in the “main-path” of standards-based markets, the essential patents did not match very well with the actual knowledge positions of the firms, in most cases. In this paper, we focus on the essential patents declared by the member firms in JTC1, an SSO that provides a standards development environment related to the development of the worldwide information and communication technology (ICT) standards for business and consumer applications, and that employs social network analysis techniques to investigate the knowledge positions of the patents, not only in the “main-path” discussed in the earlier literature, but also in the brokerage processes. We found that the brokerage-process approach helped us to better understand the roles of the essential patents that dominate transactions, relations, and the exchange of knowledge in the patent citation network than that of the main-path. Our findings suggest that claiming essentiality depends on the strategic behavior not only of the patents’ owners, but also of the SSOs."

Patent transaction markets involve two major factors: 1) the market power of transactional negotiation and 2) the technological connections of an industry. This article explored the strategic intentions within the transaction market. This article examines the thin film transistor liquid crystal display patents in the United States Patent and Trademark Office database from 2002 to 2012 to identify patent transactions. By using social network analysis, this article measures market status and industrial constraints. The results show that patent transaction markets are highly structured, a core stratum controls most transactions. Major transactors demonstrate various value propositions and constitute four transactional typologies. The findings, which encapsulate the essence of technology or knowledge transfer markets, are relevant to strategic deployment for acquiring competitiveness."

Negative binomial regression was used to analyse the influences of networks positions on exploratory innovation and the moderating effect of network density. Results reveal that network prominence and structural holes have inverted U-shaped effects on exploratory innovation. The simultaneous occupation of prominent positions and structural holes hinders exploratory innovation. Network density exerts positive and negative effects on the relationships between network prominence and exploratory innovation and between structural holes and exploratory innovation, respectively. The conclusions drawn in this study provide a reference for R&amp;D network structural optimization toward exploratory innovation."

AI has also been introduced in the disaster area to replace humans and contribute to the prevention of disasters and the minimization of damages. So, it is necessary to analyze disaster AI in order to effectively make use of it. In this paper, we analyze the patent documents related to disaster AI technology. We propose Bayesian network modeling and factor analysis for the technology analysis of disaster AI. This is based on probability distribution and graph theory. It is also a statistical model that depends on multivariate data analysis. In order to show how the proposed model can be applied to a real problem, we carried out a case study to collect and analyze the patent data related to disaster AI."

Considering the growth potential of blockchain technologies, countries around the world are attempting to graft into various fields such as finance, logistics, and healthcare, and actively promoting technology development. Tracing and analyzing the developmental trajectories of blockchain technology can give great insight for RD direction and strategies. We developed an improved knowledge persistence-based main path approach to identify technological trajectories of the blockchain technology. In addition, future technological directions for each sub-technology under blockchain technology were identified by the knowledge unconventionality metric. The results show that the blockchain technology can be divided into five sub-technologies, and each sub-technology has evolved with high technological interactions among other sub-technologies. Based on the last knowledge streams of the main paths, this paper suggests potential future directions for each sub-technology in the blockchain technology."

The findings also provide a theoretical basis for the UIC policymakers of energy-saving environmental protection industry. Design/methodology/approach The present study will take energy-saving technology as an example, through using a two-mode network analysis method to build the four-stage IPC code UIC innovation-technology network, researching UIC innovation network applicant heterogeneity, UIC technology network and technology relevance. Findings Through the establishment of UIC innovation-technology two-mode network, namely, applicant node CN and IPC node TN, this paper analyzes the important applicants, focal technologies, correlation of focal technologies and the development trends of energy saving technology in the future by using the related theories and methods of two-mode network. Originality/value At present, only about 11% of energy-saving enterprises in China have R&amp;D activities.

However, the existing literature still lacks descriptions of the cooperation characteristics and innovation landscape of blockchain. This study uses the social network analysis method to compare the development of blockchain technology and technological collaboration in China and in the United States based on patent data. Our analyses suggest that the number of blockchain patent applications in China is increasing rapidly due to the Chinese Government developing consistent national strategies for blockchain technology. In all, both countries have notable agglomerations in a few geographical areas or cities. However, the university or enterprise block in the United States has broader and deeper cooperation, unlike the Chinese university or enterprise block, which is more inclined to cooperate within blocks and has more isolated blocks. Lastly, there are various patent attributes-influencing factors behind the importance of node cooperation. The results show that the degree of cooperation of cooperative inventors or important patents is greater in China’s cooperation network, while in the United States, the influence of enterprises rather than universities or individuals is greater."
Paper_68,"With the development of 5G, mobile communication, ...",Paper,"With the development of 5G, mobile communication, and optical communication technologies, semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) have become an important research topic. However, most SOA-related studies have focused on a technical discussion or market research but have failed to indicate the critical SOA technologies and the SOA technology development trends. Therefore, this study analyzes SOA patents and constructs a technology network for SOA patents. The results indicate that the critical SOA technologies are mainly used in lasers, semiconductor lasers, light guides, electromagnetic wave transmission communication other than radio-wave communication, and devices controlling light sources. Among the five critical SOA technologies, lasers (H01S3) account for the highest percentage at 22.21%. Consequently, the critical technologies do not focus on specific technology fields but have characteristics of multiple technology fields. In addition, considerable development has occurred in semiconductor lasers in recent years. Finally, patentee analysis indicates that for SOA technologies, the public sector and academia play relatively weak roles in early technology development or following technology development. However, with the rapid development of mobile communication and optical communication, the government of each country can consider investing additional R&amp;D funds and resources in the future. This study constructs a network model for patent technologies to explore the development tendencies for SOA technologies. This model can be used as a reference for R&amp;D resource management and the promotion of new technologies."
Paper_69,This work focuses on the long-term structural evol...,Paper,"This work focuses on the long-term structural evolution of the telecommunication switching industry, analyzing both the technology and the firm level. The first contribution of this work is in the empirical representation of technological change. Following the growing field of research about the use of patent citation networks for mapping technological trajectories, this methodology is applied to the telecommunications switching industry. Furthermore, given the paucity of analytical tools for the analysis of patent citation networks from a technology dynamics perspective, a completely new method is developed. Loosely based on the notion of ""inheritance of genes"", some indicators of cumulativeness of knowledge are developed and used for detecting the emergence of new technologies within a patent citation network. The second contribution is in the tradition of evolutionary economics, that is to provide an in depth case study of industry evolution. In particular, following the Sectoral System of Innovation approach, a chapter of this work is devoted to the analysis of the structural evolution of the telecommunication switching industry. This corresponds to considering the industry long-term development and focusing on several aspects, such as the emergence of new technologies, changes in firms competences and skills, firms’ diversification and integration strategies, and the role of public authorities and institutions. The analysis of the structural evolution intends to enrich the bulk of appreciative theorizing about the co-evolution of technology and industry in an oligopolistic and regulated sector. This thesis includes both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The former mainly consist of the use of secondary sources and empirical data for reconstructing technology, industry, and firm evolution. The latter is carried out analyzing a patent citation network built using patents related to telecommunication switching granted between 1963 and 2001. Part I (chapter 2) introduces the reader to some theoretical issues covered in the thesis and provides the underpinning of what we could call the ""general assumptions"" of the thesis. These are: the theoretical support of an industry level study, the link between technology and industrial dynamics, and a cognitive approach to technical change. Finally, this chapter ends with the explicit stating of the research questions. Part II (chapters 3 and 4) represents a piece of qualitative research that focuses on the technological development and the industry structural evolution. In particular, chapter 3 provides a detailed account of technology evolution in telecommunication switches, whose aim is to highlight the technological history of telecommunication switches and which technological bottlenecks materialized. This chapter argues that technological progress in the industry follows a ""challenge-and-response"" pattern where the main driver appears to be the solution of emerging technical bottlenecks. Furthermore, this chapter also underlines the issue of performance measurement (i.e. service characteristics) stressing the ""not-off-the-shelf"" nature of telecommunication switches and the interoperability to other network infrastructures. Chapter 4 is an account of the structural evolution of the telecommunication switching industry from its infancy until recent years. As this means to consider several aspects both at firm and industry level, the chapter is divided in two parts. In the first part the industry is considered as a whole and for each period five dimensions are systematically discussed. These are: (i) market structure, (ii) barriers to entry, (iii) demand, (iv) relevant actors end their relations, and (v) source of knowledge and technology. In the second part firms are considered individually with special attention to their (common) genealogy, their national context, their technological competences, and their patterns of diversification and specialization. Part III (chapters 5 and 6) centers on the analysis of technology dynamics through the use of patent citation networks. In particular, the analysis tries to couple qualitative and quantitative research, moving beyond just considering patents as a ""count unit"" and considering also their descriptive contents. The analysis focuses on two aspects: (i) mapping the main flow of knowledge within a directed network using the established method proposed by Hummon and Doreian (1989) and (ii) the analysis of the newly introduced concept of knowledge persistence. We could consider these two chapters as an empirical counterpart of chapter 3, as they provide an empirical representation of the technological evolution and of the exploration of the available technological space. The first step of this type of analysis is the re-framing of the history of technology (chapter 3) in the technological paradigms and trajectories framework. This analysis examines the technological advance through the lenses of engineering heuristics and pinpoints what search strategies engineers used over time. In this setting, paradigms can be distinguished by looking at the stability of such heuristics, the need for new technological competences, and the emergence of new technical bottleneck. The second aspect of technology dynamics is knowledge persistence and the long term knowledge flows in the network. A patent citation network represents a system of knowledge generation and transmission (through citations), and this makes possible to identify the most successful patents in spreading their knowledge to later patents. This corresponds to study each patent citation structure from a global network perspective. In chapter 6 this is operationalized by using genetic concepts such as the Mendelian law of genes inheritance. Finally, in Part V, chapter 7 provides a summary of the main findings of this thesis, discusses their implications, and suggests future lines of research. As regarding industry evolution we can conclude that despite several waves of radical technological change this industry displays a ""slow dynamics"". This is rooted in a slow innovation process and adoption through long-term procurement contracts. Furthermore, looking at the major players reveals a large degree of heterogeneity in term of firms internationalization and telecommunication specialization. As regarding the empirical investigation of technology dynamics we can conclude that the proposed method is successful in clustering patents according to different technological paradigms. Furthermore, it emerges that the adaptation of a new radical technology (i.e. packet switching) to the telephony network took place through the intense exploration of a limited part of the available technological space."

Methods Relevant literature published until 13 August 2021, was retrieved from six electronic databases. Randomized clinical trials of Chinese patent medicines containing red yeast rice in patients with hyperlipidaemia were included in the review. Network meta‐analysis was performed using Stata 13.1 software. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) curve probability values were used to rank the treatments. Results This study included 47 trials involving 4824 subjects. In terms of reduced total cholesterol levels, Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 84.5%) had the highest probability of being the most effective formulation, with Simvastatin (66.4%) and Zhibitai (65.4%) ranked second and third, respectively. Xuezhikang also had the highest probability of reducing low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels to the greatest extent (SUCRA: 82.6%) with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 74.9%) and Zhibituo (SUCRA: 52.8%) being the second and third choices, respectively. For reduced triglyceride levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 80.2%) exhibited the highest probability of being the most effective, with Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 63.4%) and Simvastatin (SUCRA: 57.6%) in second and third places, respectively. Finally, in terms of improving high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, Zhibituo (SUCRA: 90.1%) had the highest probability of being the most effective, with Simvastatin (SUCRA: 82.1%) and Xuezhikang (SUCRA: 51.1%) ranked second and third, respectively. Conclusions Xuezhikang was found to have the highest probability of being the most effective formulation for reducing total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, while Zhibituo had the highest probability of being the most effective for controlling triglyceride and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. The studies included in the review exhibited certain limitations and, therefore, more rigorously designed studies should be performed.

We have chosen big data-based smart logistics technology as the scope of our analysis. To accomplish this, we first extract relevant patents by identifying technical keywords from prior literature and industry reports related to smart logistics. We then employ a technology prospect analysis to assess the innovation stage. Our findings indicate that smart logistics technology is in a growth stage characterized by continuous expansion. Moreover, we observe a future-oriented upward trend, which quantitatively confirms its classification as a hot technology domain. To predict future advancements, we establish an IPC Temporal Network to identify core and converging technologies. This approach enables us to forecast six innovative logistics technologies that will shape the industry’s future. Notably, our results align with the logistics technology roadmaps published by various countries worldwide, corroborating our findings’ reliability. The methodology presents in this research provides valuable data for developing R&amp;D strategies and technology roadmaps to advance the smart logistics sector."

We attempt to close the gap between the two kinds of approaches by introducing a new methodology for the analysis of political discourse called Discourse Network Analysis. It is based on social network analysis and qualitative content analysis and takes an entirely relational perspective. Political discourse can be analyzed in a dynamic way, and the approach makes previously unobservable cleavage lines and alignments measurable at the actor level, at the level of the contents of a discourse, and a combined layer. We compare discourse network analysis with political claims analysis, a competing method, and apply both methods to the European-level discourse on software patents. Our results demonstrate how an anti-software-patent coalition was mobilized and how it gained control over important frames, while the well-organized pro-software-patent discourse coalition was not able to gain sovereignty over the discourse."

Recently, economic competitiveness for both depends on technological prowess. Patents are a representative index of technological competitiveness because a patent document has diverse and detailed information about developed technologies. Hence, patent analysis is an efficient tool for technology management activities such as R&D planning and technology marketing. In this paper, we propose a patent analysis method using Bayesian network models. A Bayesian network is a graphical model representing the relationships between variables. We use International Patent Classification codes as the variables of a Bayesian network model to obtain the technological associations between codes. We verify the performance of our research using retrieved patent documents related to the BMW motor company."

This network meta‐analysis (NMA) was designed to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines combined with chemotherapy for gastric cancer on the National Basic Medical Insurance Drugs List of China. Methods . A comprehensive literature search was performed in seven electronic databases from their inception to February 25, 2020, aiming to collect all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines as an adjuvant for gastric cancer. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Scale. NMA was then performed by using STATA 16.0 software and ADDIS 1.16.8 software. Results . Finally, 30 RCTs were included, involving seven kinds of oral Chinese patent medicines, with a total of 2602 patients. For improvement of clinical efficacy, Bazhen granule combined with chemotherapy was ranked first for effectiveness, followed by the Cinobufacin capsule combined with chemotherapy and Xiao’aiping tablet combined with chemotherapy. Meanwhile, Bazhen granules combined with chemotherapy also were ranked first in reducing gastrointestinal reactions. In terms of improving performance status, the Xiao’aiping tablet was the best and significantly better than other oral Chinese patent medicines. Besides, the Zhenqi Fuzheng granule combined with chemotherapy was best for reducing the incidence of leucopenia. Conclusions . Since only one RCT of Bazhen granule was included in this study for analysis, its statistical efficiency is low. Therefore, this study recommends that the Cinobufacin capsule combined with chemotherapy should be a priority in improving clinical efficacy. In terms of improving patients’ quality of life, Xiao’aiping tablet is the best choice. Safety was best for Zhenqi Fuzheng granule and Bazhen granule combined with chemotherapy. Limited by the quantity, quality, and possible bias of included studies, the above conclusions need to be further verified by more high‐quality RCTs."

Randomized controlled trials of oral Chinese patent medicines for primary liver cancer were retrieved from CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Cochrane Library and EMbase databases from inception to May 2020. According to the Cochrane recommendation standard, the quality of the included articles was evaluated, and the data were analyzed by RevMan, R software and GeMTC software. A total of 10 kinds of oral Chinese patent medicines and 68 RCTs were included. Network Meta-analysis results showed that: as compared with TACE alone, 10 kinds of oral Chinese patent medicines combined with TACE showed advantages in effective rate, 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, KPS score improvement rate and reduced adverse reaction incidence. In the pairwise comparison of oral Chinese patent medicines, the results showed that Cidan Capsules were superior to Jinlong Capsules and Xihuang Pills in 1-year survival rate. According to the probabi-lity ranking results: Shenyi Capsules and Ganfule were more obvious in improving the effective rate; Cidan Capsules and Shenyi Capsules were more effective in improving the 1-year survival rate; Pingxiao Capsules and Shenyi Capsules had better efficacy in improving 2-year survival rate; Huaier Granules and Shenyi Capsules had better efficacy in improving the quality of life; Huisheng Oral Liquid and Ganfule were more effective in reducing the incidence of adverse reactions(such as nausea, vomiting and leukocytosis). The current evidence showed that oral Chinese patent medicine combined with TACE was superior to TACE alone in efficacy and safety. In terms of the effective rate, 1-year survival rate, 2-year survival rate, KPS score improvement rate and reduced adverse reaction incidence, the optimal treatment measures were Shenyi Capsules, Cidan Capsules, Pingxiao Capsules, Huaier Granules and Huisheng Oral Liquid in turn. However, due to the limitations of the research, the current level of evidence is not high, and clear conclusions and evi-dence strength still need to be further verified and improved by high-quality researches."
Paper_78,Are lone inventors more or less likely to invent b...,Paper,"Are lone inventors more or less likely to invent breakthroughs? Recent research has attempted to resolve this question by considering the variance of creative outcome distributions. It has implicitly assumed a symmetric thickening or thinning of both tails, i.e., that a greater probability of breakthroughs comes at the cost of a greater probability of failures. In contrast, we propose that collaboration can have opposite effects at the two extremes: it reduces the probability of very poor outcomes—because of more rigorous selection processes—while simultaneously increasing the probability of extremely successful outcomes—because of greater recombinant opportunity in creative search. Analysis of over half a million patented inventions supports these arguments: Individuals working alone, especially those without affiliation to organizations, are less likely to achieve breakthroughs and more likely to invent particularly poor outcomes. Quantile regressions demonstrate that the effect is more than an upward mean shift. We find partial mediation of the effect of collaboration on extreme outcomes by the diversity of technical experience of team members and by the size of team members' external collaboration networks. Supporting our meta-argument for the importance of examining each tail of the distribution separately, experience diversity helps trim poor outcomes significantly more than it helps create breakthroughs, relative to the effect of external networks."

For patent documents, it does not provide keyword information, which makes the keyword based technology prediction method have some limitations in revealing research content and hidden topics in specific fields. In order to better reflect the technical information in the patent, this paper combines topic analysis and social network analysis to study the development trends of gene editing technology. First, the patent data of gene editing technology is collected from Derwent Innovations Index. Secondly, text mining software is adopted to draw a network graph of topic words, combined with Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to construct a weighted adjacency matrix, and Social Network Analysis is used to obtain the degree of centrality of technical topic words. Finally, the technological trends of gene editing technology is explored by identifying the core themes of gene editing, highlighting themes and emerging themes, and some meaningful conclusions are also obtained. Based on the analysis results, this study finds that the development of gene editing technology is limited by factors such as ethics, law and cellular pollution. In addition, future research directions will be more inclined to optimize the safety and efficiency of gene editing technology."

The waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration technology offers a viable and potentially profitable technical solution to this booming phenomenon. The highly complex and systematic nature of WTE technologies have led to the emergence of WTE innovation network in the past decade. This study applies complex network theory as well as social network analysis to investigate the social network structure evolution of WTE technologies in terms of global network properties, major actors' centrality and collaboration relationships. Based on the data-set covering joint filing patents pertaining to waste heat over the period 2006–2015, this study finds that the overall WTE innovation network exhibits the properties of scale-free network with minority organizations linking to abundant organizations. A large fraction of major actors represent the first-movers in the WTE research and still control the technological trajectories. The collaboration relationships have moved toward higher level of multidisciplinary and larger technological distance. Overall, the evolution of WTE innovation network features a young state of industry with high regime dependence. Finally, some suggestions are proposed to shed light on benign development of WTE innovation network."

Retrospectively, previously published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of four different Chinese patent medicines combined with ACEI or ARB in the treatment of patients with early DN were searched overall from databases. The data were analyzed by R, Generate Mixed Treatment Comparisons and STATA softwares. A total of 78 RCTs were finally included. Network meta-analysis showed that the total effective rate of the Jinshuibao capsule-ACEI/ARB combination group and Huangkui capsule-ACEI/ARB combination groups were better than the others; Jinshuibao capsule-ACEI/ARB combination group reduced the 24-h urinary protein excretion (24-h UTP), urine microalbumin excretion rate (UAER), serum creatinine (Scr), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) values. The Huangkui capsule-ACEI/ARB combination demonstrated a better reduction of (blood urea nitrogen [BUN]). Reduced incidences of adverse effects were only observed on treatment with Bailing capsule-ACEI/ARB combination. In early DN, combination of Jinshuibao capsule-ACEI/ARB provided the highest effective rate; moreover, it could reduce the 24-h values of UTP, UAER, Scr, and HbAlc; Huangkuai capsule-ACI/ARB combination group showed a good effect on reducing BUN.

In order to promote such win-win alliances, it is necessary to consider the capabilities of large firms and SMEs, respectively. Thus, this paper proposes a new approach of partner selection when a large firm assesses SMEs as potential candidates for R&amp;D collaboration. The first step of the suggested approach is to define the necessary technology for a firm by referring to a structured technology roadmap, which is a useful technique in the partner selection from the perspectives of a large firm. Second, a list of appropriate SME candidates is generated by patent information. Finally, a Bayesian network model is formulated to select an SME as an R&amp;D collaboration partner which fits in the industry and the large firm by utilizing a bibliography with United States patents. This paper applies the proposed approach to the semiconductor industry and selects potential R&amp;D partners for a large firm. This paper will explain how to use the model as a systematic and analytic approach for creating effective partnerships between large firms and SMEs."

A patent citing another implies that the cited patent contains a piece of previously existing knowledge that the citing patent is building upon. Understanding the development of the patent citation network contributes to the discovery of the rules that govern its growth. By adopting a citation-based recursive ranking method for patents, the evolution of new fields of technology can be traced. Specifically, a reinforcement learning based ranking algorithm was adopted and found more appropriate than the now classical PageRank algorithm. The temporal evolution of patent classes and the eventual interaction among them were studied by combining regression and clustering methods. While some patterns for the network dynamics have clearly been identified, more work is needed to see the details and to be able to make predictions for the emerging fields of technologies."

The paper proposes two approaches using patent data to examine the technological convergence. First, we conduct a patent network analysis using the patent citation, which can be considered as a knowledge flow among technological fields. Second, in order for more specific analysis, the co-classification among technologies is carried out to measure the convergence intensity, rate, and coverage. Finally, by using the coverage intensity and rate, we propose two portfolio matrices to manage the technological convergence."
Paper_92,Background: Stable angina is a common condition wi...,Paper,"Background: Stable angina is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. It has been reported that combining oral Chinese patent medicines (OCPMs) and Western medicine (WM) could potentially achieve a better effect than WM alone. However, the optimal OCPMs for stable angina remain controversial and merit further empirical research. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Ovid-Medline, Clinical Trials.gov , China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, Weipu Journal Database, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database were all searched from inception to 13 March 2022. We employed Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (ROB2) to assess the overall quality of the selected studies. We also used R 4.1.2 and STATA 14.0 software applications to perform network meta-analysis, followed by sensitivity and subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 179 randomized controlled trials with 16,789 patients were included. The selected trials were all assessed as some concerns. OCPMs combined with WM had a better treatment effect than WM alone. In terms of the effective clinical rate, a significant increase was detected for Qishen Yiqi dripping pill (QSYQ)+WM as compared with Shensong Yangxin capsule (SSYX)+WM, Shexiang Baoxin pill (SXBX)+WM, Tongxinluo capsule (TXL)+WM, Xuefu Zhuyu capsule (XFZY)+WM, Qiliqiangxin capsule (QLQX)+WM, Naoxintong capsule (NXT)+WM, Fufang Danshen dripping pill (FFDS)+WM, and Danlou tablet (DL)+WM. QSYQ + WM had the highest-ranking probability (98.12%). Regarding the effective rate in ECG, QSYQ + WM was superior to SXBX + WM, TXL + WM, DL + WM, FFDS + WM, and NXT + WM. QSYQ + WM ranked first (94.21%). In terms of weekly frequency of angina, QLQX + WM obtained a better effect than FFDS + WM, Kuanxiong aerosol (KXQW)+WM, NXT + WM, QLQX + WM, SSYX + WM, SXBX + WM, and TXL + WM. QLQX + WM ranked first (100.00%). Regarding the duration of an angina attack, KXQW + WM was superior to SSYX + WM; KXQW + WM ranked first (95.71%). Adverting to weekly nitroglycerin usage, TXL + WM had the highest-ranking probability (82.12%). Referring to cardiovascular event rate, DL + WM had the highest effect (73.94%). Additionally, SSYX + WM had the lowest rate of adverse drug reactions (1.14%). Conclusion: OCPMs combined with WM had a higher efficacy. QSYQ + WM, QLQX + WM, KXQW + WM, TXL + WM, DL + WM, SSYX + WM, and SXBX + WM merit further investigation. SXBX + WM is presumably the optimal treatment prescription for both clinically effective and cardiovascular event rates. Further high-quality empirical research is needed to confirm the current results.

Paper_93,Identification of prevalent problems is an importa...,Paper,"Identification of prevalent problems is an important process of strategic innovation for stakeholders of trending technologies. This paper proposes a systematic and replicable method of patent analysis to identify problems to be solved requisite for sustainable technology planning and development, by implementing the concept of ‘context’ to facilitate problem identification. The main concept of the method entails the importance of the connections between contextual information and problems to provide more focused, relevant, and constructive insights essential for instating goals for research and development activities. These context–problem entities and their entwined connections are discovered using keyword pattern matching, grammar-based text mining, and co-word analysis techniques. The intermediary outputs are then utilized to generate the proposed context–problem network (CP net) for social network, grammar, and quantitative data analysis. For verification, our method was applied to 737 patents in the wireless energy transmission technology domain, successfully yielding CP net data. The detailed analysis of the resulting CP net data delivered meaningful information in the wireless charging technology field: The main contexts, “batteries”, “power transmission coils”, and “cores”, are found to be most relevant to the main problems, “maximizing coupling efficiency”, “minimizing DC signal components”, and “charging batteries”. The results provide a wide range of informative perspectives for individuals, the scientific community, corporate, and market-level stakeholders. Furthermore, the method of this study can be applicable to various technologies since it is independent of specific subject domains. Future research directions aim to improve this method for better quality and modeling of contexts and problems."
Paper_94,Patent statistics provide insight into a range of ...,Paper,"Patent statistics provide insight into a range of economic phenomena in the economics of innovation. Since the earliest research using patent data, it was recognized that patents are highly heterogeneous with a minority of patents having much greater impact and value than others. Citation counts are a key measurement of patents, observable directly from patent bibliographic data, which carries information about patent characteristics. But patent citations form a complex network that carries more information about patents than the number of a patent's immediate neighbors.This dissertation explores network measures that exploit this structure to extract more information about patents. The first chapter of this dissertation is addressed to network centrality and the measurement of patent value. The centrality of a patent is negatively related, after controls for citation counts, to public company market value. This establishes that centrality measurements carry information about patent attributes beyond citation counts, and suggests a clear market saturation phenomenon that may drive the result.The next chapter considers whether patent centrality measurements can detect probable holdup in the economic space of patents. Patent pools associated with technical standards, such as the MPEG-2 video compression method, can relate to inventions subject to many competing rights. Centrality measurements are lower for patents that are in the patent pool, suggesting a line of research into the measurement of patent complementarity and substitute relationships.The remaining chapter concerns technology identification from patent citations. Classifying patents by technology is a common necessity in patent empirics, and existing approaches using administrative classification suffer certain inevitable limitations due to the nature of the classification system. Community detection algorithms can use citations to break patents into natural groups. An empirical analysis shows that the communities thus produced contain more information than administrative classifications and can detect underlying technological changes before the classification system does."

PubMed, Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang, VIP and other databases were retrieved by computers from the establishment of the databases to June 2020. Randomized controlled trials(RCTs) of Chinese patent medicines for the treatment of unstable angina pectoris were collected. Two investigators independently screened out the literatures, and extracted data according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included RCTs was evaluated according to the bias risk assessment tool recommended by the Cochrane System Reviewer Manual, and the Stata 13.0 software was used for data analysis and mapping. Through screening, 28 eligible studies were finally included, with the sample size of 2 885 cases, involving 8 Chinese patent medicines. The results of the network Meta-analysis showed that in terms of total effective rate for angina symptom improvement, the order was as follows: Shenshao Capsules &gt; Naoxintong Capsules &gt; Ginkgo Ketone Ester Dripping Pills &gt; Compound Danshen Dripping Pills &gt; Ginkgo Leaf Tablets &gt; Shexiang Baoxin Pills &gt; Tongxinluo Capsules &gt; Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules; in terms of total effective rate for ECG curative effect, the order was as follows: Ginkgo Ketone Ester Dripping Pills&gt;Compound Danshen Dripping Pills &gt; Tongxinluo Capsules &gt; Shenshao Capsules &gt; Shexiang Baoxin Pills &gt; Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules; in terms of hypersensitivity-C-reactive protein curative effect, the order was as follows: Tongxinluo Capsules &gt; Shenshao Capsules &gt; Ginkgo Leaf Tablets&gt;Compound Danshen Dropping Pills&gt; Shexiang Baoxin Pills &gt; Naoxintong Capsules &gt; Yindan Xinnaotong Soft Capsules &gt; Ginkgo Ketone Ester Dropping Pills. Chinese patent medicine combined with conventional therapy can improve the clinical efficacy of unstable angina pectoris. Due to the differences in the quantity and quality of the included studies, the order results of Chinese patent medicines need to be further verified."
Paper_96,"Objectives: To evaluate and compare the efficacy, ...",Paper,"Objectives: To evaluate and compare the efficacy, safety, and cost of nine Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in treating early diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Design: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, clinicaltrials.gov, SinoMed, Chinese Biomedicine, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, and Chongqing VIP Information databases were comprehensively searched from the beginning to February 2022. Review Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including Bailing capsule (BLC); Jinshuibao capsule (JSB); Huangkui capsule (HKC); Compound Xueshuantong capsule (CXC); uremic clearance granule (UCG); Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT); tripterygium glycosides (TG); Keluoxin capsule (KLX), and Shenshuaining tablet (SSNT) combined with ACEI/ARB for patients with early DKD were reviewed. Data Synthesis: Two reviewers independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean difference (MD) were reckoned to assess dichotomous variable quantities and continuous variable quantities, respectively. Using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA), we then ranked each therapeutic regime. Results: Ultimately, 160 RCTs involving 13,365 patients and nine CPMs were included. UCG showed significantly higher probabilities on urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) when compared with ACEI/ARB group, with MD of −47 (95%CI) (−57, −37) and SUCRA 98.0%. The CXC group achieved a remarkable improvement in overall response rate (ORR) compared with ACEI/ARB (RR, 1.3, 95%CI (1.2, 1.5)) with SUCRA 91.9%. SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of serum creatinine (Scr) (−19 (−26, −12), SUCRA 99.3%) and adverse effects (AEs) (0.46 (0.17, 1.1), SUCRA 82.9%). BLC showed the greatest effectiveness on 24 h urinary total protein (24 h UTP) (−170 (−260, −83), SUCRA 78.5%) and triglyceride (Trig) (−0.89 (−1.2, −0.53), SUCRA 97.0%). From the cost-effectiveness analysis of CPMs in China, the cost of TG, SYKFT and CXC was 108, 600, and 648 RMB, respectively, per 3 months and were ranked in the top three. Conclusion: UCG and CXC might be the optimum selection for improving UAER and ORR, and SSNT could be significantly superior to ACEI/ARB group in terms of Scr and AEs. BLC shows the best curative effect on 24 h UTP and Trig. TG shows the highest cost-effectiveness among the nine CPMs."
Paper_97,This study proposes a different angle to evaluate ...,Paper,"This study proposes a different angle to evaluate patent value, namely regarding patent value as a combination of static characteristics and dynamic relationship. On one hand, a majority of patent static characteristics are fixed in their application, which means these characteristics are controlled by the owner of patent; on the other hand, the dynamic citation relationship is formed by forward citation and backward citation, which means not controlled by the owner. If a patent takes an important position in other citation relationships, this implies the patent has more chance to gain and control technology and knowledge, and to have an important influence on subsequent patents. In other words, this patent is valuable. This study applies social network analysis to carry out the research purpose, regarding patent as a node and citation as the connection between nodes to build patent citation network. This study can provide a thinking mode based on social network analysis for companies; offer a more rational way to evaluate patent value from the perspective of dynamic development; construct an effective early warning mechanism for patent litigation."
