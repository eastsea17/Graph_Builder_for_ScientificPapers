Methods . A comprehensive <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">literature search</span> was performed in seven electronic databases from their inception to February 25, 2020, aiming to collect all related randomized controlled trials (RCTs)</span> to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral Chinese patent medicines as an adjuvant for gastric cancer.

Finally, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">30 RCTs</span> were included, involving seven kinds of oral Chinese patent medicines, with a total of 2602 patients.

Meanwhile, Bazhen granules combined with chemotherapy also were ranked first in reducing gastrointestinal reactions. In terms of improving performance status, the Xiao’aiping tablet was the best and significantly better than other oral Chinese patent medicines. Besides, the Zhenqi Fuzheng granule combined with chemotherapy was best for reducing the incidence</span> of leucopenia. Conclusions . Since only one RCT of Bazhen granule was included in this study for analysis, its statistical efficiency is low. Therefore, this study recommends that the Cinobufacin capsule combined with chemotherapy should be a priority in improving clinical efficacy. In terms of improving patients’ quality of life, Xiao’aiping tablet is the best choice. Safety was best for Zhenqi Fuzheng granule and Bazhen granule combined with chemotherapy. Limited</span> by the quantity, quality, and possible bias of included studies, the above conclusions need to be further verified by more high‐quality RCTs.
