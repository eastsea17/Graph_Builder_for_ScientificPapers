    In recent years, <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">assessing patent risks has</span> attracted fast-growing attention from both researchers and practitioners in studies of technological innovation. Following the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">existing literature</span> on risks and intellectual property (IP) risks, we define patent risks as the lack of understanding of the distribution of patents that lead to losing a key patent, increased research and development costs, and, potentially, infringement litigation. This paper aims to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">propose an explorative approach to</span> investigating patent risks in the target technology field by integrating social network analysis and patent analysis. Compared to previous research, this study makes an important contribution toward identifying <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">patent risks in the overall technological field by employing a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">patent-based multi-level network model</span> that has not appeared in existing methodologies of patent risks. In order to verify the effectiveness of this approach, we take <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">artificial intelligence (AI)</span> as an example. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Data collected from</span> the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) database were used to build the patent-based multi-level network on patent risks from market, technology, and assignee perspectives</span>. The results indicate that the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">lack of international collaborations</span> among assignees and industry–university–research collaboration may lead to patent collaboration risks. Regarding patent market risks, the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">lack of overseas patent applications, especially</span> the lack of distribution in the main competitive markets, is a key factor. As for patent technology risks, most of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">leading assignees lack awareness</span> of the distribution in the following technological fields: industrial electric equipment, engineering instrumentation, and automotive electrics. In summary, assignees from the U.S. with first mover advantages are still powerful leaders in the AI technology field. Although China is catching up very rapidly in the total number of AI patents, the apparent patent risks under the perspectives of collaboration, market, and technology will obviously hamper the catch-up efforts of China’s AI industry. We conclude that, in practice, the proposed patent-based multi-level network model not only plays an important role in helping stakeholders in the AI technological field to prevent patent risks, find new technology opportunities, and obtain sustainable development, but also has significance for guiding the industrial development of various emerging technology fields.
