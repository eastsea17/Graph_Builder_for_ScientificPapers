The results demonstrated that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Chinese patent medicine intervention</span> was superior to oral western medicine treatment in improving the patient’s condition as assessed by the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Activities of Daily Living (ADL), effective rate, and Alzheimer’s Disease</span> Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-Cog). Particularly, the effect of Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention was prominent. Meanwhile, Chinese patent medicine intervention in AD did not significantly increase the risk of adverse reactions. The results of the Network Meta-analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine had statistically significant differences in the MMSE score, ADL score, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog score, compared with both western medicine alone and Chinese patent medicine alone. In terms of adverse reactions, the difference <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">between Chinese patent medicine intervention and simple oral western medicine was statistically significant. The results of further ranking probability analysis demonstrated that Chinese patent medicine combined with western medicine intervention</span> ranked first in terms of MMSE, ADL, effective rate, and ADAS-Cog. Additionally, oral <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Chinese patent medicine intervention alone ranked first in reducing adverse reactions</span>. In the funnel plots of the MMSE, ADL, and effective rate, most studies were symmetrically distributed on both sides of the midline, where small sample effects and publication bias might exist to some extent. However, this <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">conclusion</span> still needs to be combined with clinical syndrome differentiation and treatment, and more large-sample, multi-center, high-quality studies are needed for further verification.
